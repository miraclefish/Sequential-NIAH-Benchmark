This will be the basis for allocating the total sales amount. Ensure the valuation is accurate and based on current market rates or prices.\n\n2. **Calculate the allocation ratio**: Based on the fair values determined in step 1, calculate the ratio of the value of the goods to the value of the gifts. If, for example, the goods are valued at $70 and the gifts at $30, the ratio of goods to gifts is 70:30.\n\n3. **Allocate the total sales amount**: Using the ratio calculated in step 2, allocate the total sales amount between the goods and the gifts. If the total sales amount is $100, using the 70:30 ratio, $70 would be allocated to the goods and $30 to the gifts.\n\n4. **Issue separate invoices**: Finally, issue separate invoices for the goods and the gifts based on the allocated amounts. The invoice for the goods would reflect $70, and the invoice for the gifts would reflect $30.\n\nExample:\n\n- Total sales amount: $100\n- Fair value of goods: $70\n- Fair value of gifts: $30\n- Allocation ratio: 70% for goods, 30% for gifts\n- Allocated amount for goods: $100 * 70% = $70\n- Allocated amount for gifts: $100 * 30% = $30\n\nIssue an invoice for the goods in the amount of $70 and another invoice for the gifts in the amount of $30."}

Explored the evening lights of the Eiffel Tower during a guided tour.\n\n\n\nQuestion: \nSummarize the paper: \"Probabilistic Cellular Automata: Formalism and Symmetry\" and list the main points of the paper. \n\nThe paper discusses the relationship between probabilistic cellular automata, quantum mechanics, and fermionic quantum field theories. It introduces a formal framework for describing cellular automata using Grassmann variables and Fermi-Dirac statistics. The main points of the paper include:\n\n1. Introduction of a bit-fermion map: A map that relates classical bits to occupation numbers of fermions, enabling the description of cellular automata in terms of fermionic quantum field theories.\n\n2. Discussion of cellular automata with particle-hole symmetry: A symmetry that conserves the number of particles and holes modulo two, leading to an equivalent automaton with a simple updating rule.\n\n3. Definition of the step evolution operator: An operator that encodes the updating rule of the automaton, determining the time evolution of the wave function.\n\n4. Derivation of the quantum rule for expectation values: A rule that relates the expectation value of an observable to the wave function and the operator associated with the observable.\n\n5. Introduction of operators for observables: Operators that act on the wave function, including non-commuting operators such as the Hamiltonian and momentum operator.\n\n6. Discussion of fermion operators: Operators that describe the annihilation and creation of fermions, used to express observables and the dynamics of fermionic quantum systems.\n\n7. Analysis of vacua, order parameters, and spontaneous symmetry breaking: The selection of the true state of a system may depend on particular initial conditions or small disturbances.\n\n8. Description of single-particle wave functions: Wave functions that describe the probability to find a particle at a given position, used to study the evolution of particles in the context of quantum mechanics.\n\n9. Derivation of the Dirac equation: A relativistic wave equation that describes the evolution of a fermion in a potential, obtained from the discretized fermionic model.\n\n10. Discussion of coarse graining and the emergence of quantum mechanics: The process of averaging over degrees of freedom leads to a loss of information and the emergence of quantum mechanics, characterized by a unitary but non-deterministic evolution.\n\n11. Introduction of complex structures: A framework for describing charged particles, based on the particle-hole transformation and the combination of two Majorana spinors into a Dirac spinor.\n\nThe paper demonstrates that probabilistic cellular automata can be used to describe various quantum field theories and quantum systems, including those with interactions and symmetries, and provides a framework for understanding the relationship between cellular automata, quantum mechanics, and fermionic quantum field theories.\n\nMain results:\n- A bit-fermion map relates classical bits to occupation numbers of fermions.\n- The step evolution operator determines the time evolution of the wave function.\n- Expectation values can be computed using the quantum rule.\n- Non-commuting operators, such as the Hamiltonian, play a crucial role in the description of automata.\n- The paper establishes a connection between probabilistic cellular automata and fermionic quantum field theories.\n\nImplications:\n- The formalism provides a tool for the study of complex quantum systems.\n- The connection between automata and quantum field theories allows for the application of powerful quantum field theory methods to the study of automata.\n- The emergence of quantum mechanics from coarse graining provides insight into the nature of quantum systems.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a framework for understanding the relationship between cellular automata, quantum mechanics, and fermionic quantum field theories, and demonstrates the potential of probabilistic cellular automata in describing various quantum systems."}

It explicitly represents local knowledge bases' subjective  perspectives on the relationships between different domains of interpretation while enabling the formalization of constraints among these domains. \nFrom the formal point of view, this semantics can be seen as the integration of the semantics of several propositional and first\\ftext{-}order theories that are connected via, so-called, bridge rules. These enable to transfer truth from one theory to another under certain conditions without imposing logical omniscience principles (such as the requirement that if a knowledge base $\\Gamma$ knows $\\co{\\phi}{i}$, and $\\co{\\phi}{i}\\models_{\\IC}\\co{\\psi}{j}$, then \\(\\Gamma\\models_{\\IC} \\co{\\psi}{j}\\)). \n\n\\begin{defn}[DFOL Semantics]\n\t\\label{def:dfol-semantics}\n\tLet $\\{L_i\\}$ be a family of first\\ftext{-}order languages defined over a non\\ftext{-}empty set $I$ of indexes. For any assignment $a\\) and any \\(i\\) in \\(I\\), the set of \\(i\\)\\ftext{-}models \\(M_i\\) is a set of first\\ftext{-}order interpretations of \\(L_i\\) such that \\(\\forall \\phi \\in L_i^c, m \\models\\phi[a]\\) for all \\(m \\in M_i\\).\n\tA DFOL model \\(\\M = \\{\\{M_i\\}, \\{\\dr_{ij}\\}\\}\\) for \\(\\{L_i\\}\\) is a pair where, for each \\(i, j \\in I\\), \\(M_i\\) is a set of local models of \\(L_i\\), and \\(\\dr_{ij}\\) is a domain relation from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\). A labeled formula \\(\\co{\\phi}{i}\\) is satisfied by a DFOL model \\(\\M\\) with respect to an assignment \\(a\\), denoted by \\(\\M \\models\\co{\\phi}{i}[a]\\), if \\(a\\) is admissible for \\(\\co{\\phi}{i}\\), and \\(\\forall m \\in M_i, m \\models\\phi[a_i]\\).\n\tA model \\(\\M\\) satisfies a bridge rule \\(\\co{\\phi_1}{i_1},\\ldots,\\co{\\phi_n}{i_n}\\to\\co{\\phi}{i}\\) if \\(\\forall a\\) strictly admissible for \\(\\co{\\phi_1}{i_1},\\ldots,\\co{\\phi_n}{i_n}\\), if \\(\\M \\models i_1:\\phi_1[a], \\ldots, \\M \\models i_n:\\phi_n[a]\\), then \\(\\exists a'\\geq a\\) admissible for \\(\\co{\\phi}{i}\\) such that \\(\\M \\models i:\\phi[a']\\).\n\tA set of formulas \\(\\Gamma\\) entails a formula \\(\\phi\\) with respect to a set of bridge rules \\(\\IC\\), denoted by \\(\\Gamma \\models_{\\IC} \\phi\\), if every \\(\\IC\\)\\ftext{-}model \\(\\M\\) and every assignment \\(a\\) admissible for \\(\\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\M \\models\\Gamma[a]\\), there exists an extension \\(a'\\geq a\\) admissible for \\(\\phi\\) such that \\(\\M \\models\\phi[a']\\).\n\\end{defn}\nTo interpret partial knowledge in a local model we use a set of models, where the empty set of models represents a local inconsistency. To interpret subjective knowledge, that is, knowledge that is relative to a particular knowledge base, we use bridge rules to connect differen\\ftext{t} knowledge bases. The notion of satisfiability is based on the notion of assignment, where \\(a_i(x) = d\\) means that, for the \\(i\\)\\ftext{-}th knowledge base, \\(x\\) is interpreted as \\(d\\). If an assignment is admissible for a formula, then all the variables in the formula are interpreted, except possibly for arrow variables, which represent objects in other knowledge bases and can be undefined when not in the scope of a quantifier. An assignment \\(a\\) is an extension of \\(a'\\) if \\(a_i(x) = a_i'(x)\\) for all variables \\(x \\in X_i\\), where \\(X_i\\) is the set of variables of \\(L_i\\). The semantics of DFOL also includes a notion of logical consequence, which is defined in terms of the notion of satisfaction, such that \\(\\Gamma \\models_{\\IC} \\phi\\) if every \\(\\IC\\)\\ftext{-}model \\(\\M\\) and every assignment \\(a\\) admissible for \\(\\Gamma\\) such that \\(\\M \\models\\Gamma[a]\\), there exists an extension \\(a'\\geq a\\) admissible for \\(\\phi\\) such that  \\(\\M \\models\\phi[a']\\). Bridge rules have the same semantics as before, where \\(\\M \\models\\co{\\phi_1}{i_1},\\ldots,\\co{\\phi_n}{i_n}\\to\\co{\\phi}{i}\\) if \\(\\forall a\\) strictly admissible for \\(\\co{\\phi_1}{i_1},\\ldots,\\co{\\phi_n}{i_n}\\), if \\(\\M \\models i_1:\\phi_1[a], \\ldots, \\M \\models i_n:\\phi_n[a]\\), then \\(\\exists a'\\geq a\\) admissible for \\(\\co{\\phi}{i}\\) such that \\(\\M \\models i:\\phi[a']\\)."}

An explicit formula for the pairing of a motivic class with a cohomology class is given, confirming a conjecture of Gross and Savin.\n\nContext\nThe work \\cite{CLR} studies the contribution of the motivic cohomology to the residue at \\(s=0\\) of \\(L(s, \\pi, \\mathrm{Spin})\\), where \\(\\pi\\) is a cohomological cuspidal automorphic representation of \\(\\mathrm{PGSp}_6(\\mathbf{A})\\). This paper extends the results to the residue at \\(s=1\\).\n\nMain results\nThe paper establishes that if \\(\\mathcal{I}_S(\\Phi, \\Psi^{[\\lambda,\\mu]} , 1) \\ne 0\\), then the class \\(\\mathrm{pr}_{\\pi^\\vee} \\mathcal{Z}_{\\mathbf{H}, \\mathcal{H}}^{[\\lambda,\\mu]}\\) and its Hecke translates generate \\(H^1_\\mathcal{H}(M(\\pi_f^\\vee)_{{\\bf R}}(4))\\), and the pairing between the motivic class and the cohomology class is equal to a multiple of \\(L^S(1, \\sigma, \\mathrm{Std})\\).\n\nFurther results\nThe paper also gives a formula for the integral \\(\\mathcal{I}_\\infty(\\Phi, \\Psi^0, s)\\) in terms of the Fourier coefficient of \\(\\varphi\\), and establishes the non-vanishing of this integral, which is used to prove the non-vanishing of the residue of the Spin \\(L\\)-function.\n\nConclusions\nThe main results of the paper confirm a conjecture of Beilinson and Tate and establish a connection between algebraic cycles and \\(L\\)-functions of automorphic representations of \\(\\mathrm{PGSp}_6\\).
