Initially loyal to the Qing, Yuan's eventual switch to the republican side was crucial for the revolution's success.\n   - **Yuan Shikai’s Rise to Power**: After the fall of the Qing, Yuan Shikai became a key figure in the newly established Republic of China, eventually becoming its president.\n\n3. **Warlord Era (1916-1928)**:\n   - **Fragmentation and Regional Control**: Following Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China fragmented into regions controlled by various warlords, including those from the Beiyang clique. This period was marked by constant conflicts between different factions.\n   - **Beiyang Warlords and Their Rivalries**: The Beiyang Warlords, including Duan Qirui, Feng Guozhang, and Cao Kun, among others, vied for power and control. Their armies clashed frequently, leading to a period of instability and warfare.\n\n4. **Northern Expedition and the End of the Warlord Era (1926-1928)**:\n   - **Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang (KMT)**: The Northern Expedition, led by Chiang Kai-shek and the KMT, aimed to unify China by defeating the warlords and bringing the country under a single government.\n   - **Defeat of the Beiyang Warlords**: The success of the Northern Expedition led to the defeat of the Beiyang Warlords and the establishment of a unified government in Nanjing, marking the end of the Warlord Era.\n\n5. **Legacy and Impact**:\n   - **Political and Social Impact**: The Beiyang Warlords played a significant role in shaping China's political landscape during the early 20th century. Their actions and rivalries had profound impacts on the country's stability and its people.\n   - **Modernization Efforts**: Despite their infighting, the warlords also oversaw various modernization efforts in their respective domains, including infrastructure development, educational reforms, and military modernization.\n\nOrganizing the history of the Beiyang Warlords in this manner provides a clear timeline of their development, from their origins in the late Qing reforms to their eventual downfall during the Northern Expedition. It highlights their complex roles in Chinese history, including their contributions to modernization and their involvement in the country's tumultuous transition from imperial rule to republican governance."}

In WeChat space, users often see sellers offering Apple iPhones at prices far below those in physical stores and e-commerce websites. Such unusually low prices often hide scams.\n2. Attracted by the low price, users try to contact the seller. The seller explains the low price with reasons such as internal employee discounts from the manufacturer, clearing excess inventory, or sourcing from special channels.\n3. The seller usually asks the user to pay first and promises to ship afterward. Some sellers may even fabricate text messages from courier companies, making the buyer believe that the goods are on the way, while in reality, there are no such goods.\n4. After the buyer makes the payment, the seller often disappears and becomes unreachable. As a result, the buyer neither receives the product nor gets their money back.

On the 14th, she's in Copenhagen; on her own but playing a bill with Hugh Tweedie (the Sauna Youth and Flamingods drummer currently spinning his own plates as a solo musician) and Tanja Vesterbye Jessen (a Denmark VJ and electronic music performer turning in on herself to create personal, monolithic audio-visual sets as well as the more psychedelic architecture-come-sound-art of Tanja & The Paradox Group.\n\nOn 16th March, Bell will be playing in an evening of \"sound, space and the underground\" in Hackney, curated by filmmaker/photographer/webcaster Emily Richardson, with a backdrop of short films by Emily and others touching on the same themes of psychological dislocation, landscape and technological/societal shift. Looming over the evening is the substantial presence of David Toop, a polymath musician and musical thinker who's chased sounds from the RS Thomas mysticities of 'Sleep' through Fripp/Eno/Can-inspired avant-folk and on to two-turntables-and-a-mixer deconstructions of jungle and drills. These days you can find him colliding improvisation with post-exotica, working on audio pieces about swarming bees or the sonic possibilities of a decommissioned RAF Vulkanaer bomber station.\nOn a more performance-art oriented note, the 27th March event (at the abandoned intense cinema that is the Chatham Historic Dockyard's fantastic Space) is a live audio-visual in-conjunction with, among others, the \"atmospheric scientist and audio/visual artist\" known as Gaze Is Ghost (Milee Furtado) who, when not creating and presenting 'site-specific, immersive sound art' with a penchant for haunting, forgotten or derelict places, plays in various bands. It's all in the service of a 'sonic investigation' of the Dockyard's naval/space history, its sense of suspended time and its copresence of the martial and the celestial, as embodied in the bleak, repurposed architecture.\n\nI'm not sure who's joining Bell Lungs for the 28th March album launch gig for 'Wolves Behind Us' in London – it might just be her alone. Either way, it's bound to be a hypnotic, immersive night, a concert-cum-ritual-in-the-making, bringing her own inimitable performance aura to the fore.

Plus further shows in March for Bell Lungs with David Toop and Rashad Becker, and a date with Gaze Is Ghost\nI've got a bit of a catch-up to do, so let's take a look at the upcoming tour by Bell Lungs, and then I'll add a few more bits of news and relevant dates at the end...\nAs previously mentioned, avant-folk singer/writer/sometime promoter Ceylan Hay (a.k.a. Bell Lungs) is a rising force in British psychedelic folk. With a background in promoter activities and a keen sense of listening, she's built up a vibrant network of experimental and folk-tinged friends and like minds. Until the end of February, she's embarking on an eight-date British tour, with the musical and visual project Raiments joining her for the full journey.\nThe tour begins and ends in Scotland, with a particular focus on the country's more out-of-the-way places, and takes in assorted English venues from the south coast to the north-east, including a pay-what-you-can show in a Bristol shop, a Sheffield event in a Quaker meeting house, and an Edinburgh bookshop session. It's a mostly female-led affair, with many of the gigs featuring female-centric or female-dominated bills. Bell Lungs will be playing material from her forthcoming 'Wolves Behind Us' EP, an exploration of \"human identity, frontier lands, nostalgia, and the instinct to run to the wild when times are rough\". Raiments, meanwhile, will be offering their \"lo-fi or no-fi\" sound, born from the desolate landscapes of the Galloway countryside and the decaying post-industrial landscapes of Lanarkshire.\nAlso along for the ride are a variety of intriguing support acts. In Glasgow, it's Despicable Zee – a.k.a. Zee, a writer and electronic music producer, and her \"poetic and musical project of self-love and exploration\" which \"tells the story of a first-generation immigrant and her experiences with colourism, feminism, and healing\". In Stirling, Michael Clark (presumably not the Michael Clark who's best known for his 1980s work with The Byson Family and Scrambled Eggs) will join in; while in Newcastle it's the turn of The Nature Centre, the solo project of Leah Wellnowski (which grew out of her work as singer and songwriter with neo-psychedelic rockers The Psychedelic Circus). The Nature Centre's music aims to capture the drama and grandeur of nature – \"earth and land, sun and sky\" – via a folky doom-rock sound which incorporates field recordings and cello-heavy instrumentation.\nIn Brighton, support will be provided by Halcyon Jane, the psychedelic dream-pop project of guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Sophie Webster, who's released a couple of albums of \"lo-fi lushness\" built around her atmospheric songs and soundscaping, and who's also one half of the duo Halcion Waves. For the Sheffield date, Tara Clerkin Trio will provide their folk-infused post-punk sound, drawing on the elements of Tara's own songs of personal politicised struggle and drawing comparison to both the Raincoats and to Elliott Smith.\nThe tour will also feature various DJ sets from a host of female selectors. Set times, support acts and DJs are likely to be subject to change – I suggest checking on the event details (or on the Facebook event page) for the latest information before each gig.\nHere are the dates:\n20th February 2019 – The Hug and Pint, 171-173 Great Western Road, Glasgow, G4 9HZ, Scotland (with Raiments + Despicable Zee) – information here\n21st February 2019 – The Glad Café, 1006 Pollokshaws Road, Glasgow, G41 2HG, Scotland (with Raiments) – information here\n22nd February 2019 – The Coach House, St. Ninians, Stirling, FK8 3AD, Scotland (with Raiments + Michael Clark) – information here\n23rd February 2019 – The Old Hairdressers, 23 Renfield Lane, Glasgow, G2 6PH, Scotland (with Raiments + The Nature Centre + Halcyon Jane) – information here\n24th February 2019 – The Peacock Inn, Park Lane, Dumfries, DG1 1HH, Scotland (with Raiments) – information here\n25th February 2019 – The Cumberland Arms, James Place Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE6 1LD, England (with Raiments + Tara Clerkin Trio) – information here\n27th February 2019 – The Prince Albert, 48 Trafalgar Street, Brighton, BN1 4ED, England (with Raiments + Halcyon Jane) – information here\n28th February 2019 – Cafe OTO, 18–22 Ashwin Street, Dalston, London, E8 3DL, England (with Raiments + various DJs) – information here\n1st March 2019 – The Edge, 79-81 Cheapside, Deritend, Birmingham, B12 0QH, England (with Raiments) – information here\n2nd March 2019 – The Coffin Tavern, 3 Welbeck Street, Nottingham, NG2 3AB, England (with Raiments) – information here\nAfter the Raiments tour is over, Bell Lungs will be performing a few more shows in March – a 14th March gig in Copenhagen with Hugh Tweedie and Tanja Vesterbye Jessen, a 16th March \"sonic investigation\" event in London's x Church with David Toop and Rashad Becker, and a 27th March appearance with Gaze Is Ghost in the Chatham Historic Dockyard's Space (a site-specific performance dealing with the Dockyard's naval/space history and its copresence of the martial and the celestial).\nMore on those in a moment, but for now the focus is on the tour...\nTags: Bell Lungs, Brighton (England), Bristol (England), David Toop, Despicable Zee, Dumfries (Scotland), Gaze Is Ghost, Glasgow (Scotland), Halcyon Jane, Hugh Tweedie, London (England), Michael Clark, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (England), Nottingham (England), Raiments, Rashad Becker, Sheffield (England), Stirling (Scotland), Tara Clerkin Trio, Tanja Vesterbye Jessen, The Nature Centre\nCategories 2019, ambient music, art pop, art punk, art rock, chamber music, classical fusion, dance performances, DIY music, drone music, electro-acoustic music, electronic, experimental music, experimental pop, folk music, improvisation, instrumental music, noise, performance art, pop, post-classical, post-progressive rock, previews, psychedelic folk, psychedelic rock, rock, singer-songwriter, sound collage, spoken word, storytelling\nJanuary 2019 – upcoming London gigs – Gabriella Swallow Experiments (23rd January); Grand Union Orchestra’s jazz/Asian-fusion spectacular (26th January)\nThere are two intriguing gigs coming up in London this month, merging a wide range of musical influences.\n\nThe first, on 23rd January, features cellist Gabriella Swallow in a new collaboration at the tiny, mercurial Strongroom Bar in Shoreditch.

It's worth noting that Gabriella's own musical history and tastes draw on a wide range of influences from jazz, folk and pop to classical and experimental: as a performer, she's worked with the likes of Gwilym Simcock, Tim Harries, Thomas Gould, the London Sinfonietta and The Divine Comedy, and has been a member of the experimental Acoustic Triangle trio and the string quartet Gabrieli Consort.\n\nThe second gig, on 26th January, features twenty-piece jazz band Grand Union Orchestra at the Hackney Empire, celebrating their own thirty-five years of music. Founded by guitarist and composer Tony Haynes, the orchestra (who are also marking the final gig on their current tour) specialise in a unique and energetic blend of African, Asian, Caribbean and Latin American musical influences with British jazz and other European traditions. This particular evening is billed as “a spectacular evening of music with a stunning array of international musicians” and will feature a set of pieces based on the migrations and settlements of British communities – both those arriving from abroad and those moving within the country, and the stories which these migrations have inspired.\n\nGrand Union Orchestra @ Hackney Empire, 26th January 2019\nMore information on the Grand Union Orchestra gig here: if you're interested in the Gabriella Swallow Experiments show, keep an eye on the Strongroom website or just turn up early to see what's happening.\nTags: Gabriella Swallow, Grand Union Orchestra, London (England), Tony Haynes\nCategories 2019, Afro-funk, Asian music, big band jazz, Caribbean music, classical (Western art music), classical fusion, Cuban music, crossover, DIY music, electro-acoustic folk, electro-acoustic music, experimental music, folk, folk-jazz, improvisation, Indian music, instrumental music, jazz, jazz fusion, jazz rock, Latin music, mambo, merengue, post-bop, previews, salsa, samba, world & indigenous music\nDecember 2018 – upcoming London gigs – post-punk and art rock with The Hare And Hoofe, Belly, ILL and The Flix at Whimsy Woodland (14th December); experimental sounds from The Magic City Trio, Ingrid Laubrock and Viktoria Szábó at Iklectik (15th December)\nA couple of London gigs to add to the season of merriment and introspection, both of them showcasing post-punk, art rock and experimental tendencies:\n\nWhimsy Woodland presents:\nThe Hare And Hoofe + Belly + ILL + The Flix\nFriday, 14th December 2018, 7.00pm – information here and here\nThis gig features a set of post-punk and art-rock acts at an offbeat, Woodland-themed venue in Shoreditch.

In the first of these, the legendary 100 Club plays host to a triple-bill of Crass-associated/inspired experimental rock, auralgic sonic manipulation and uncompromising avant-garde noise from The Blockheads, Loop and Faust.\nThe 100 Club presents:\nThe Blockheads + Loop + Faust\nTuesday 4th December 2018, 7.30pm – information here, here and here\nThe Blockheads are a British rock institution, founded by Ian Dury out of the ashes of pub-rockers Kilburn & The High Roads; although Dury himself passed away in 2000, the band has continued (with a loyal and growing fan base) under the aegis of keyboard player and songwriter Chaz Jankel. Expect sharp, ruminative songs, a dose of Dury-esque wordplay and jazz-infused, rock-powered musicality. I’ve not got much info on the setlist or the current lineup, but here’s a clip of them in action from a few years ago:\nLoop are a reunited British psychedelic rock institution from the 1980s; a key act in the scene which also spawned Spacemen 3, Moonflowers and The Jesus and Mary Chain. With their drones, feedback and pounding rhythms, they create a hypnotic and immersive wall of noise: a kind of avant-garde, deconstructive take on rock music which also draws in electronic elements. Here’s a fairly lengthy, typical example:\nFaust are a similarly legendary, more recent reunion of another key band from German art-rock’s 1970s heyday. Initially part of the Düsseldorf “krautrock” scene, they evolved into a kind of collective, punk-infused avant-garde entity which mixed noise, musique concrète and rock elements with equal disdain for convention. A first wave of influential work ended in 1975, after which various members pursued solo or quiet careers until a reunion in the 1990s. Currently, this version of Faust features founding members Jean-Hervé Péron (guitar, voice) and Werner “Zappi” Diermaier (drums), plus long-standing member Uwe Nettelbeck (keyboards, vocals).\nThroughout the 4th December event, auralculis will be providing sonic embellishments between sets, building on and manipulating sounds from the evening’s performances to create an immersive aural atmosphere.\nA few days later, the Vortex Jazz Club hosts a celebration of the life, work and legacy of the late Lol Coxhill – a singular, innovative figure in British music, with a career spanning from the 1960s to his death in 2012. This will be the fourth annual memorial event for him: a night of music making that Lol would have appreciated, with a lineup featuring several of the musicians who worked with him.\nThe Vortex Jazz Club presents:\nCelebrating Lol Coxhill (featuring Gigrin, The Goose and the Abdominal Twitch, The Recedents, The Scorched Earth Orchestra and more)\nSaturday 8th December 2018, 7.30pm – information here and here\nThe lineup includes the Gigrin duo (a collaboration between singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Alison Blunt and Ivan Hussey, formerly of 1970s/80s London punk-experimentalists The Pop Group and The Glaxo Babies, and more recently of the avant-jazz collective AAAAA); The Goose and the Abdominal Twitch (a solo project from composer and improviser Caroline Kraabel which incorporates autoharps, electronics and pre-recorded sounds); The Recedents (the collective group of drummer/ vocalist Charles Hayward, clarinettist/saxophonist/occasional guitarist Caroline Kraabel, singer/festival organiser/Amateur Choirs conductor Sylvia Hallett and others, conducting spontaneous group improvisations with an emphasis on release and surprise); The Scorched Earth Orchestra (a large ensemble which generates an aggressive, overwhelming take on music, deliberately exploiting or disrupting the hierarchical structures of band and audience).\nThere will also be a performance by the “Lol Coxhill Legacy Collective”, a lineup of players drawn from Lol’s last few years of working, and the evening will be MCd by another longtime collaborator, poet andarbiter of the London Musicians’ Collective, Adrian Mitchell.\nTags: AAAAA, Alison Blunt, Caroline Kraabel, Charles Hayward, Chaz Jankel, Faust, Gigrin, Ian Dury, Ivan Hussey, Jean-Hervé Péron, Lol Coxhill, Loop, Sylvia Hallett, The Blockheads, The Glaxo Babies, The Goose and the Abdominal Twitch, The Pop Group, The Recedents, The Scorched Earth Orchestra, Uwe Nettelbeck, Werner “Zappi” Diermaier\nCategories 2018, a cappella, acoustic music, alternative rock, ambient music, art punk, art rock, cabaret, ceremonial music, chaos music, classical fusion, dance music, drone music, electro-acoustic music, electronic, experimental music, experimental pop, experimental/avant-garde rock, folk music, free jazz, garage rock, glitch music, improvisation, industrial music, instrumental music, interactive performances, jazz, kosmische & Krautrock, loop music, musique concrete, New Music, noise, noise rock, performance art, plunderphonics, poetry, post-punk, previews, psychedelic rock, punk rock, rock, singer-songwriter, skronk, sound collage, soundscapes, techno, vocal music\nNovember 2018 – upcoming London gigs – the return of Barringtone, with Flies and Honey (21st November); Kavus Torabi and Jo Quail’s show with My Tricksy Spirit and Cian Nugent (28th November)\nQuick news on a couple of London gigs from the more experimental end of the indie/underground scene…\n\nBarringtone + Flies and Honey\nThe Victoria, 451 Queensbridge Road, Hackney, London, E8 3AS, England\nWednesday 21st November 2018, 8.00pm – information here and here\nThe first gig features the return of Barringtone, a phantasmagoric and illogical British rock band who’ve been away for a while. Their journey began in the mid-2000s, founded by ex-Clor-er Barry Dobbin, who excelled in wringing out pop songs from a shifting kaleidoscope of dippy, perfidy-inspired lyrics and careering art-rock/psych instrumentation. They’ve had an on-off career, but have always been a welcome and unpredictable presence; so it’s good to see them back in action.\nIn support are Flies and Honey, a newish London-based psychedelic folk project with a taste for the ‘60s and for “weird and wonderful instruments”. I don’t know much more about them yet, but they seem to enjoy jaunty bell-playing and melodies which bounce like a springboard between different psychedelic and baroque traditions – plus a bit of '60s Lovin' Spoonful vibraphone fun (just because you can). They look and sound like a lot of fun.\nKavus Torabi + My Tricksy Spirit + Cian Nugent\nThe Courtauld Gallery/London Contemporary Music Festival presents:\nKavus Torabi + Jo Quail\nThe Courtauld Gallery, Somerset House, Strand, London, WC2R 0RN, England\nWednesday 28th November 2018, 7.00pm – information here, here and here\nThe second gig features Kavus Torabi, one half of erstwhile psychedelic duo Knifeworld and currently one fifth of the current Gong lineup, among other projects. For this show, he’s performing in a new duo with Jo Quail, the talented experimental cellist from various contemporary classical and folk-experimental projects (not least her own).\nThe event’s part of the London Contemporary Music Festival, which this year is “exploring the concept of the ‘post-contemporary’ in music and performance”, whatever that might mean. The evening also features a pair of solo sets, one from Cian Nugent (the Irish guitarist who, in addition to his own work, has played with Tir Na Nog and Jackie Oates, and who releases “cosmic”-tinted instrumental albums on the Wigan-based Cardinal Fuzz label) and one from My Tricksy Spirit (a.k.a. Natalia Posnova, who creates layered, enchanting experimental folk/Russian world-pop using the kinds of instruments you’d expect to see in a Russian folk ensemble, but also delving into electronica and other contemporary trappings).\nTags: Barringtone, Cian Nugent, Clor, Flies and Honey, Gong, Jackie Oates, Jo Quail, Kavus Torabi, Knifeworld, London Contemporary Music Festival (LCMF), My Tricksy Spirit, Natalia Posnova, Tir Na Nog\nCategories 2018, a cappella, acoustic music, alternative folk, alternative rock, art rock, baroque pop, chamber music, classical fusion, drone music, electro-acoustic folk, electro-acoustic music, experimental music, experimental pop, folk baroque, folk music, folk rock, improvisation, instrumental music, loop music, New Music, noise, performance art, pop, previews, progressive rock, psychedelic folk, psychedelic pop, psychedelic rock, Russian folk, singer-songwriter, space rock, spoken word, vocal music, world & indigenous music, worldbeat\nNovember 2018 – upcoming London gigs – intense atmosphere and performance with Jenny Hval and Shirley Collins (14th November); eclectic international folk and a dash of experimental noise with the Nest Collective (16th November)\nHere are a couple of upcoming shows in London, featuring a couple of artists (or, in one case, an artist collective) who don’t often get covered in here. Both are on the cusp of folk, but while one is a direct exponent of it, the other operates in the more experimental periphery.\nThe Norwegian singer-songwriter Jenny Hval comes to the Hackney Arts Centre on 14th November, in support of her latest album ‘The Long Sleep’. The music she writes is a dark, sensual, often unsettling atmospheric form of confessional art pop which draws on her own experiences and on the textures of life and the body. Drawing on her own experiences of femininity, love and the female body – as well as her own particular interests in existentialism and the nature of consciousness – Jenny creates songworlds which are both intimate and unsettling, tangible and strange.\n\nI don’t often get the chance to feature Jenny in here, but she’s certainly worth covering. Her early work as Rockettothesky (a more pseudonymous, more experimental incarnation) explored the world of noise-rock and avant-folk; but her more recent work as Jenny Hval has been a more direct and personal take on art pop, in which she explores the intricacies of love, sensuality and the introspective self with growing directness and much emotional depth. It’s songcraft which is both highly individual and in tune with the shifting, unfixed feelings of the current age.\n\nThe evening before the Jenny Hval gig, folk legend Shirley Collins appears at the Union Chapel, as part of the ‘In London’ series. A revered British folk singer with a career spanning over sixty years (and a key influence on the ’60s folk revival), Shirley is a significant name and a genuine treasure. She’s had an extraordinary and sometimes difficult life, which has informed her music in various ways, and she’s still actively making and releasing music to this day.\nFor this event, she’ll be performing old and recent songs, accompanied by a small acoustic band featuring Ian Kearey (of Oysterband), Dave Arthur and a couple of other friends. It promises to be an intimate and special evening of folk, with readings from her memoir ‘All in the Downs’ and an audience Q&A.\n\nJust a couple of days after Shirley’s show, on 16th November, the Nest Collective heads to the Forge in Camden to host an international evening of folk and experimental music, featuring three very different artists.\nThe headliner this time is Lithuanian singer and fiddler Lina Lapelytė, who grounds her work in traditional Lithuanian folk while incorporating elements of ambient electronics and other contemporary trappings. She will be performing an extraordinary and mournful set on the themes of mourning and loss, from her ‘Pirutės’ (Ghosts) project.\nThe middle act of the evening is Marisa Overgard – a Canadian interdisciplinarian who mingles the line between herself as a musician, a composer, a performance artist and as an anthropologist studying folk cultures. She will be joining the Nest session with a version of ‘The Wilds’, a project she’s developed in conjunction with the Tuvan (Central Asian) throat-singing tradition – significant, since the Forge was where I first encountered Tuvan throat singing many years ago, courtesy of the Alash Ensemble.\nThe opening act is the British experimental musician and performance artist Cosmo Sheldrake, who’s best known for his energetic and theatrical stage presence as well as his improvisational and sampling-based approach to music, which he uses to span a wide experimental/folk/techno spectrum. Cosmo is a frequent, energetic collaborator in many musical and performance art contexts and his Nest set is likely to feature multiple personalities, instruments and unexpected musical turns.\nNest Collective presents:\nLina Lapelyte + Marisa Overgard + Cosmo Sheldrake\nThe Forge, 3-7 Delancey Street, Camden Town, London, NW1 7NL, England\nFriday 16th November 2018, 7:30pm – information here and here\nTags: Cosmo Sheldrake, Ian Kearey, Jenny Hval, Lina Lapelyte, London (England), Marisa Overgard, Rockettothesky, Shirley Collins, The Nest Collective\nCategories 2018, ambient music, art pop, DIY music, electro-acoustic folk, electro-acoustic music, electronic, experimental music, experimental pop, folk music, improvisation, instrumental music, loop music, New Music, noise, performance art, previews, psychedelic folk, singer-songwriter, sound collage, spoken word, techno, throat singing, world & indigenous music\nOctober 2018 – upcoming London gigs – the return of Kavus Torabi with The Utopia Strong (4th October), and a Guitar Workshop with Boehm/Lambert/Russell (27th October)\nKavus Torabi is back in London, and so is his project The Utopia Strong. For those who don’t know, Kavus was the guitarist/main man of the recently-dissolved Cardiacs (a band in which his anarchic punk-infused psychedelic sensibilities made a crucial contribution) as well as being a key contributor to various other projects over the years (including Knifeworld, Guapo, Mediæval Bæbes and others).\nThe Utopia Strong is a collaborative project/team-up with Steve Davis (the snooker player, who’s also a DJ and electronic music enthusiast) and composer/producer Michael J. York. Tagging themselves as a “collective of sonic outsiders”, they create and perform a kind of music which is (as Kavus puts it) “a kind of psychedelic, abstract, experimental, electronic, krautrock, post-progressive, tunnel-vision of sound”, drawing on and blending a wide range of influences. The band’s first public performance is at Servant Jazz Quarters in Dalston on 4th October. I’ll let them have the word:\n“During a shamanic journey in the deserts of Joshua Tree, Steve and Kavus discovered they had a shared love for Krautrock, electronic music, and progressive rock, as well as a passion for collecting rare synthesizers. Michael J. York, master of audio manipulation and bassist extraordinaire, weaved their individual sounds together to create something truly unique. The Utopia Strong are now ready to take their numerical magic to the stage, featuring a 5.1 surround sound system, and a barrage of pulsating visuals.”\nIf you’re intrigued by the idea of the Utopia Strong initiating you into a “tunnel-vision of sound”, you can get tickets for the 4th October gig here. I’ll be there, and I’ll be expecting an immersive and aforemetioned experience…\n\nA few weeks later, on 27th October, there’s a chance to experience the world of improvisation with a workshop and concert featuring the trio of guitarist Adrian Boehm, saxophonist Jonny Lamb and drummer Paul Russell.\nAdrian is the organiser of this Guitar Workshop, which focuses on improvisation and “the unknown, the unexplored, and the freedom of just ‘being’ and expressing in the moment.” He’s been busy with various other projects, including the “atmospheric soundscapes and ambient textures” of his Splinter band and a range of collaborative albums with fellow improvisers. For this particular event, he’s joined by composer and performance artist Jonny Lamb (also of Hysterical Injury and Clocolan) who brings his own performance showmanship and experimental approach to the table, and by drummer and composer Paul Russell"}

{"md5": "e1f0b5bd1bb83d0237a4519d2dba93c5", "answer": "IoT technology can be used to achieve real-time data collection and storage from multiple sensor nodes to the cloud through the following steps:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Sensors convert various types of real-time data into electrical signals, including temperature, humidity, illumination, air pressure, vibration, etc.\n2. **Data Translation**: Since the sensors generate analog signals, it is necessary to convert the analog signals into digital signals through an A/D converter for subsequent transmission and processing.\n3. **Transport Layer**: Transmit the converted data to the cloud through the Internet of Things networks (such as LoRa, NB-IoT, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, etc.). Each of these technologies has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, LoRa is suitable for devices with low frequency, long-distance, and long battery life, while Wi-Fi is suitable for devices with short-distance, high-bandwidth, and continuous power supply.\n4. **Cloud-side Reception and Storage**: Once transmitted to the cloud, we can use Internet of Things communication protocols such as MQTT, CoAP, etc., and transmit data to the server through the TCP/IP protocol. These protocols provide a standardized communication method between devices and servers.\n5. **Data Processing and Application**: Data can be processed in real-time in the cloud, providing functions such as remote monitoring, early warning, analysis, etc., and can be stored for subsequent analysis and use.\n\nRelated protocols and technologies include:\n\n* MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport): a lightweight messaging protocol suitable for low-bandwidth and low-power devices.\n* CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol): a protocol similar to HTTP, but designed for constrained devices and networks.\n* LoRa (Long Range): a wireless communication technology suitable for long-distance and low-power devices.\n* NB-IoT (Narrowband Internet of Things): a wireless communication technology suitable for low-bandwidth and low-power devices.\n* Zigbee: a wireless communication technology suitable for low-power and low-data-rate devices.\n* Wi-Fi: a wireless communication technology suitable for high-bandwidth and continuous power supply devices.\n* TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol): a suite of communication protocols used for transmitting data over the internet."}
{"md5": "9d1edcdbde014bcf044b60ee9f2bb2af", "answer": "Designing an effective artificial intelligence (AI) model involves several steps, including defining the problem, collecting and preprocessing data, choosing an appropriate model structure, training the model, validating and testing the model, and deploying the model to solve the actual problem. Here are the steps in detail:\n\n1. **Define the problem clearly**: The first step in designing an AI model is to clearly define the problem you are trying to solve. This involves understanding the goals and objectives of the project, as well as any constraints or limitations that may impact the model's performance.\n\n2. **Collect data related to the problem**: The effectiveness of AI training largely depends on the amount and quality of data related to the problem. Most AI models require a large amount of labeled data for training.\n\n3. **Choose the appropriate type of AI based on the problem**: This choice depends on the domain of the problem you are trying to solve. For instance, if you are dealing with natural language processing (NLP) problems, you may need to choose an NLP type AI model; if you are dealing with image recognition problems, you may need to choose a computer vision type AI model.\n\n4. **Preprocess the data related to the problem**: Before starting to train the model, the data related to the problem often needs to be cleaned and formatted. For example, you might need to convert images into pixel matrices suitable for the model, or you may need to tokenize text data.\n\n5. **Choose the appropriate model structure based on the problem**: When designing an AI model, you need to choose an appropriate model structure based on the problem you are trying to solve. Whether to use neural networks, decision trees, or support vector machines depends on your specific task.\n\n6. **Train the model for the problem**: Once you have chosen a model structure, you can start training the model for the problem you are trying to solve. This is an iterative process, and you may need to optimize your model repeatedly to achieve the best performance.\n\n7. **Validate and test the AI model for the problem**: Validate and test the performance of your AI model in solving the actual problem using data outside the training set. Whether the model is overfitting or performing well on unknown data needs to be examined in this step.\n\n8. **Deploy the trained model to the actual problem**: Once the model training is complete and achieves satisfactory performance, deploy it to solve the actual problem. Further observation and adjustment may be needed to optimize the model's performance in the real environment.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively design an AI model that solves your specific problem. Remember that AI model design is an iterative process, and you may need to revisit previous steps based on the results of later steps."}

Internally, the country faces corruption issues, low government efficiency, and a large wealth gap, which contributes to its economic struggles. Externally, Pakistan's history of unstable regime transitions, with multiple instances of military rule, has also played a significant role in its economic underdevelopment. The military plays a substantial role in Pakistan's political and economic life, and the power struggle between the military and the government sometimes leads to military coups, further exacerbating the country's economic challenges. Additionally, Pakistan's low education levels, with a high illiteracy rate, make it difficult to cultivate highly skilled young talents to drive the country's economic development, thereby exacerbating the country's poverty situation."}

{"md5": "4b743c8f08eb779c33a18a62866b8f11", "answer": "To implement image classification using deep learning algorithms, you can follow these steps:\n1. Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess a large dataset of images. This includes resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.\n2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: Design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification. This typically involves multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers for classification.\n3. Training the Model: Train the CNN model using the training dataset. This involves feeding the images through the network, calculating the loss between predicted and actual classifications, and updating the model weights using backpropagation and an optimization algorithm like stochastic gradient descent.\n4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test dataset to estimate its accuracy on unseen data.\n5. Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in applications for image classification tasks.\n\nThe working principles of deep learning in image classification involve:\n- Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to small regions of the image, scanning the image to generate feature maps that represent the presence of features like edges or textures.\n- Activation Functions: Functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are applied to the output of convolutional and fully connected layers to introduce non-linearity, allowing the model to learn more complex representations.\n- Pooling Layers: These layers downsample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions and retaining important information, which helps in reducing the number of parameters and the computational cost.\n- Fully Connected Layers: These layers are used at the end of the network for classification. Each neuron in this layer is connected to every neuron in the previous layer, allowing the model to make predictions based on the features extracted.\n- Backpropagation and Optimization: During training, the model's predictions are compared to the actual labels, and the error is calculated. This error is then backpropagated through the network, adjusting the weights to minimize the loss, typically using an optimizer like Adam or SGD.\n\nThis process enables the model to learn features from images and classify them accurately into predefined categories."}

Slave society (2070 BC to 221 BC): This stage represents the peak of the slave society, with the Xia, Shang, and Western Zhou dynasties. During this phase, the Hundred Schools of Thought contended, fostering a rich cultural spirit in Chinese history.\n\n3. Feudal society (221 BC to 1644 AD): This stage began with the unification of the six states by Qin Shi Huang, establishing a centralized system. The Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties developed new cultural, artistic, and technological advancements based on agriculture.\n\n4. Semi-colonial and semi-feudal society (1644-1949 AD): After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the Qing Dynasty was established. Meanwhile, the technological advances of the West accelerated foreign invasions, turning China into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society.\n\n5. Socialist society (1949 to the present): The establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 marked China’s departure from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal state and its transition to a socialist society. Through reform and opening up, China has gradually risen to become an important economic power in the world."}

{"md5": "75ae07000509de3c59d508e6cb031cbe", "answer": "To create intuitive and interactive charts for large datasets using the matplotlib library, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install necessary libraries**: Ensure you have installed matplotlib, numpy, pandas, and other relevant libraries. You can install or update them using pip: `pip install matplotlib numpy pandas`.\n\n2. **Import libraries**: Import the required libraries at the beginning of your code. For most plotting tasks, you'll need `matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `numpy as np`, and `pandas as pd`.\n\n3. **Load your dataset**: Use pandas functions like `read_csv()` or `read_excel()` to load your data into a DataFrame. For example: `df = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')`.\n\n4. **Explore your data**: Before plotting, it's essential to understand your data. Use `df.describe()` and `df.info()` to view basic statistical information and data types.\n\n5. **Choose a chart type**: Select an appropriate chart type based on your data and the relationships you want to showcase. Common types include scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, line charts, and pie charts.\n\n6. **Create your chart**: Use matplotlib's functions to create your chart. For example, `plt.scatter(df['column1'], df['column2'])` for a scatter plot.\n\n7. **Customize your chart**: Add a title, labels for the x and y axes, and consider other customizations like legends, gridlines, or changing colors and markers.\n\n8. **Display your chart**: Finally, use `plt.show()` to display your chart. Note that matplotlib itself does not provide interactive visualizations; for interactive charts, consider using other libraries like Bokeh or Plotly.\n\nHere's a simple example to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Sample data\ndata = {'Category': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'],\n        'Value1': [10, 15, 7, 12, 18, 9],\n        'Value2': [8, 9, 13, 10, 11, 14]}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Create a scatter plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.scatter(df['Value1'], df['Value2'])\n\n# Customize the plot\nplt.title('Relationship between Value1 and Value2')\nplt.xlabel('Value1')\nplt.ylabel('Value2')\n\n# Display the plot\nplt.show()\n```\n\nThis example creates a simple scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two columns in a dataset. You can expand on this by exploring different chart types and customizations based on your specific data analysis needs."}

{"md5": "c73d6d22b8aee94a2fd3510f155e7dc6", "answer": "The data transmission mechanism between a mobile phone and a base station involves several steps:\n\n1. **Converting data into radio signals**: When a user initiates a call, sends a text message, or accesses the internet on their mobile phone, the phone converts the data into radio signals.\n2. **Transmission to the base station**: The phone transmits these radio signals to the nearest base station, which is typically a cell tower or a rooftop antenna. The base station receives the signals and decodes them.\n3. **Forwarding to the core network**: The base station forwards the decoded data to the core network of the service provider, which is responsible for managing and routing the data to its final destination.\n4. **Processing and routing**: The core network processes the data and routes it to the intended recipient, whether it's another mobile phone, a server on the internet, or a landline phone.\n5. **Receiving data from the core network**: When the core network receives data intended for the mobile phone, it forwards the data to the base station, which transmits the data to the phone as radio signals.\n6. **Converting radio signals back into data**: The phone receives the radio signals and converts them back into data, which is then displayed on the phone's screen or used for other purposes.\n\nThis process happens rapidly, often in a matter of milliseconds, and is the foundation of modern mobile communication."}

{"md5": "185c7896f0c3d34ded121b13f716aff7", "answer": "1. **Speech Recognition**: To implement speech recognition, you can use various libraries and APIs such as Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, Microsoft Azure Speech Services, or Mozilla DeepSpeech. These services can transcribe spoken words into text.\n\n2. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: For converting text back into speech, you can use TTS APIs like Google Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or eSpeak. These tools synthesize text into natural-sounding speech.\n\n3. **Integration**: To create a system that both recognizes speech and generates speech output, you would integrate these two functionalities. For example, you could use a speech recognition API to convert a user's spoken input into text, process the text (e.g., answer a question, perform a task), and then use a TTS system to output the response as speech.\n\nHere's a simplified example of how this might work in Python using the `SpeechRecognition` and `pyttsx3` libraries for speech recognition and text-to-speech, respectively:\n\n```python\nimport speech_recognition as sr\nimport pyttsx3\n\n# Initialize the TTS engine\nengine = pyttsx3.init()\n\n# Function to recognize speech\ndef recognize_speech():\n    r = sr.Recognizer()\n    with sr.Microphone() as source:\n        print(\"Please say something:\")\n        audio = r.listen(source)\n        try:\n            print(\"You said: \" + r.recognize_google(audio))\n            return r.recognize_google(audio)\n        except sr.UnknownValueError:\n            print(\"Could not understand audio\")\n            return None\n        except sr.RequestError as e:\n            print(\"Could not request results; {0}\".format(e))\n            return None\n\n# Function to speak text\ndef speak_text(text):\n    engine.say(text)\n    engine.runAndWait()\n\n# Main program\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    text = recognize_speech()\n    if text:\n        speak_text(\"You said: \" + text)\n```\n\nThis example uses `speech_recognition` to listen to the user's speech, recognize it, and then uses `pyttsx3` to speak the recognized text back to the user."}

{"md5": "80c1164a80d7651bf83b9f5df0cc289c", "answer": "To pan-fry delicious fish fillets, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Prepare the fish fillets**: Select fresh fish fillets, and make sure they are at room temperature. Pat them dry with a paper towel to remove excess moisture.\n2. **Season the fish**: Sprinkle both sides of the fish fillets with salt, pepper, and any other desired seasonings, such as lemon juice, garlic powder, or paprika.\n3. **Heat the pan**: Heat a non-stick skillet or cast-iron pan over medium-high heat (around 400°F/200°C). Add a small amount of oil, such as olive or vegetable oil, to the pan and let it heat up for about 1 minute.\n4. **Add the fish**: Carefully place the fish fillets in the pan, skin side up (if they have skin). If the fillets are delicate, you can dust them with a little flour or cornstarch to help them brown more evenly.\n5. **Cook the fish**: Cook the fish for 3-4 minutes on the first side, or until it develops a golden-brown crust. Flip the fish over and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).\n6. **Finish with a squeeze of lemon**: Remove the fish from the pan and squeeze a sliver of fresh lemon juice over the top. This will help brighten the flavors and add a touch of acidity.\n\nTips and Variations:\n\n* Use a thermometer to ensure the fish is cooked to a safe internal temperature.\n* Don't overcrowd the pan; cook the fish in batches if necessary.\n* Add aromatics like garlic, ginger, or herbs to the pan for extra flavor.\n* Try different seasonings, such as Cajun or Asian-inspired spice blends, to give the fish a unique flavor.\n* For a crisper crust, you can dust the fish with panko breadcrumbs or grated Parmesan cheese before cooking.\n\nRemember, the key to pan-frying fish is to cook it quickly over high heat, so it develops a nice crust on the outside while remaining moist and tender on the inside. Enjoy!"}

{"md5": "6e5d8dad00de9f8c4745ba8d19c25d84", "answer": "A mobile phone uses a base station to access the internet through a process called cellular networking. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**: When you turn on your phone and connect to the mobile network, it searches for the nearest base station (also known as a cell tower) to establish a connection.\n2. **Signal transmission**: The phone sends a signal to the base station, which includes your phone's unique identification code (e.g., IMEI number) and other information.\n3. **Base station reception**: The base station receives the signal and decodes the information. It then checks the phone's identity and verifies the subscription details with the mobile network operator.\n4. **Data connection establishment**: If the verification is successful, the base station establishes a data connection with the phone, allowing it to access the internet.\n5. **Internet access**: The phone can now send and receive data to and from the internet through the base station, which acts as a gateway to the mobile network operator's core network.\n6. **Data transmission**: When you request data from the internet (e.g., browse a website, send an email), your phone sends the request to the base station, which forwards it to the mobile network operator's core network.\n7. **Data reception**: The core network receives the request, processes it, and sends the requested data back to the base station, which then transmits it to your phone.\n\nIn summary, a mobile phone uses a base station to access the internet by establishing a connection, verifying the phone's identity, and exchanging data between the phone and the internet through the base station and the mobile network operator's core network."}

Face recognition is a technology that uses a camera or other imaging device to capture an image of a person's face, and then uses algorithms to compare that image to a database of known faces to identify the person.\n\nThe working principle of face recognition involves several steps:\n\n1. Face Detection: The first step is to detect the face in the image. This is done using algorithms that can identify the location and size of the face in the image.\n2. Face Alignment: Once the face is detected, the next step is to align the face to a standard template. This involves rotating and scaling the image so that the face is in a standard position.\n3. Feature Extraction: The next step is to extract features from the aligned face image. These features can include things like the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the face.\n4. Comparison: The extracted features are then compared to a database of known faces to find a match.\n5. Identification: If a match is found, the person is identified and their information is retrieved from the database.\n\nFace recognition uses various algorithms and techniques such as:\n\n* Haar cascades: This is a popular algorithm used for face detection.\n* Principal Component Analysis (PCA): This is a technique used for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.\n* Support Vector Machines (SVM): This is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and identification.\n* Deep Learning: This is a type of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn features and make predictions.\n\nFace recognition has many applications, including security, surveillance, marketing, and social media. However, it also raises concerns about privacy and bias, and there are ongoing efforts to improve the accuracy and fairness of face recognition systems."}

During the Three Kingdoms Period (1st century BC - 7th century AD), the system was characterized by tribal alliances, with chieftains and leaders holding the highest positions. In the Goryeo Period (918 AD - 1392 AD), the system was determined by official ranks, with the level of one's official position directly affecting one's hierarchical status. The Joseon Period (1392 AD - 1910 AD) saw the combination of hereditary and examination systems, with local and central officials selected through the civil service examination to become yangban (nobles) with privileges. The bone-rank system, where family origin and bone rank (bloodline) determined an individual's social status and rights, was also present during the Silla Period (57 BC - 935 AD). Overall, the hierarchical system in Korean history has been shaped by a combination of factors, including social status, family background, and official position."}

Power generation: Electrical power is generated by power generation equipment, such as thermal power plants, hydropower plants, nuclear power plants, and wind farms.\n2. Boosting: The low-voltage electrical power generated is converted into high voltage by boost equipment, such as transformers, to facilitate long-distance transmission.\n3. Transmission: The high-voltage electrical power is transmitted over long distances via transmission lines, with minimal loss.\n4. Step-down: When the electrical power is transmitted near the users, the voltage is lowered to a suitable range for user consumption through step-down equipment, such as transformers.\n5. Distribution: The electrical power is then distributed to various users via distribution equipment, forming a complete loop in the power grid.\n6. Feedback: The power usage situation of the users is fed back to the power operators, enabling them to adjust the strategies for power generation, transmission, and distribution according to actual conditions, maintaining a stable closed loop in the power grid.\n\nThese steps work together to construct a closed loop in the power grid, allowing for efficient and reliable transmission and distribution of electrical power to meet the demands of users."}

{"md5": "c535ca5007876b46b3f97ecb78b985bc", "answer": "Managing the lifecycle of an XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object involves several steps, from its creation to the completion of the request. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to manage the lifecycle of an XHR object:\n\n1. **Creation**: Create a new XMLHttpRequest object using the `XMLHttpRequest()` constructor. This step initializes the object and sets its state to \"uninitialized.\"\n\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize the XHR object by calling the `open()` method, specifying the request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the URL of the resource to be accessed, and a boolean indicating whether the request should be asynchronous. At this point, the object's state changes to \"opened.\"\n\n3. **Setting Request Headers**: Optionally, set request headers using the `setRequestHeader()` method to specify additional information that will be sent with the request.\n\n4. **Sending the Request**: Send the request to the server by calling the `send()` method. For asynchronous requests, the `send()` method returns immediately; for synchronous requests, the `send()` method returns after the server's full response has been received. The object's state changes to \"sent.\"\n\n5. **Monitoring Progress**: For asynchronous requests, you can monitor the progress of the request by listening to the `onreadystatechange` event handler. The `readyState` property of the XHR object changes as the request progresses through the following states:\n   - `0` - Uninitialized\n   - `1` - Opened\n   - `2` - Sent\n   - `3` - Receiving\n   - `4` - Loaded\n\n6. **Receiving the Response**: During the lifecycle management of the XMLHttpRequest object, when the server starts to return a response, it is essential to track the object's state changes by listening to the `onreadystatechange` event handler. When the state changes to 'loaded' (i.e., `readyState` is `4`), you can retrieve the server's response.\n\n7. **Request Completion**: At the end of the XMLHttpRequest object's lifecycle, once the request is completed, regardless of the outcome, the object can be closed, and related resources can be released. However, in modern browsers, this step is usually handled automatically and does not require manual lifecycle management.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively manage the lifecycle of an XMLHttpRequest object, ensuring that your web application can interact with servers asynchronously and efficiently."}

The goal is to ensure that all data is in a format suitable for analysis and handle all errors and anomalies to provide accurate business condition analysis for management.\n\n2. **Choosing Charts/Graphs suited to Business Management's Needs**: To help management better understand business conditions and trends, we need to choose the appropriate visual elements based on the questions we want to answer. For example, if comparing different groups of data, a bar chart might be a good choice; if comparing the relationship between two variables, a scatter plot might be more suitable.\n\n3. **Building Data Stories to Assist Management Decision-making**: By linking multiple views and creating logical and persuasive stories based on data, we can help business management gain a more comprehensive understanding of business conditions and trends, enabling them to make informed decisions.\n\n\n\n\\section{Proof of the Completeness Theorem}\n\\label{sec:completeness}\n\n\n\\begin{thm}[Completeness]\n\\label{thm-completeness}\n$\n\\Gamma,e(\\Sigma)\\models_{\\IC} \\co{\\bigwedge_{i:\\sigma \\in \\Sigma}\\sigma\\supset\\phi}{i} \n\\Longrightarrow\n(\\Gamma,\\Sigma)\\vdash_{\\IC}\\co{\\phi}{i} \n$\n\\end{thm}\n\nThe contrapositive will be proved: it will be shown that if $(\\Gamma,\\Sigma)\\not \\vdash_{\\IC}\\co{\\phi}{i}$ then there exists a \\IC-model $\\M^c\\) and an assignment $a\\) such that $\\M \\models \\Gamma[a]$, $\\M \\models e(\\Sigma)[a]$ but $\\M \\not \\models \\co{\\bigwedge_{i:\\sigma \\in \\Sigma}\\sigma\\supset\\phi}{i}[a]$.\n\n\n\\begin{pf}\nLet $(\\Gamma,\\Sigma)\\not \\vdash_{\\IC}\\co{\\phi}{i}$.

DFOL generalises classical first-order logic by extending the syntax and semantics to accommodate multiple knowledge bases with their own languages, and by introducing domain relations to relate objects across different domains.\n\nThe syntax of DFOL consists of a family of languages {\\(L_i\\)} defined over a non-empty set \\(I\\) of indexes, where each \\(L_i\\) is a first-order language extended with a set of symbols called arrow variables. Arrow variables are propositional constants that assign propositions as objects, and are used to denote cross-domain objects and to express constraints between knowledge bases.\n\nThe semantics of DFOL is based on a family of local models, one for each language \\(L_i\\), and a family of domain relations, one for each pair of indexes \\(i\\) and \\(j\\). A local model is a set of first-order interpretations of a language \\(L_i\\) on a non-empty domain \\(\\bdom_i\\), which agree on the interpretation of a complete sub-language \\(L_i^c\\) of \\(L_i\\). The semantic overlap between different knowledge bases is explicitly represented in DFOL by means of domain relations, which are binary relations contained in \\(\\bdom_i \\times \\bdom_j\\). Domain relations illustrate how the \\(j\\)-th knowledge base represents the domain of the \\(i\\)-th knowledge base in its own domain.\n\nDFOL also introduces bridge rules, which are propositional formulas spanning over different knowledge bases, to relate cross-domain objects and knowledge. Bridge rules are used to constrain the set of possible DFOL models to those in which a conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. The semantics of a bridge rule is defined in terms of the existence of an extension of an assignment that is admissible for the conclusion, given the premises and the domain relations.\n\nDFOL provides a sound and complete calculus for reasoning about distributed knowledge bases. The calculus consists of inference rules that enable the derivation of new formulas from given ones, and is used to prove the soundness and completeness of DFOL with respect to the class of \\(\\IC\\)-models. The calculus includes rules for the propositional connectives, quantifiers, and equality, as well as rules for the bridge rules and domain relations.\n\nDFOL has been applied to various areas, including information integration, peer-to-peer data management, and ontology alignment. It provides a framework for representing and reasoning about distributed knowledge bases, and can be used to integrate and align multiple knowledge bases. DFOL has also been used to formalise and reason about distributed systems, including multi-agent systems and service-oriented architectures.\n\nIn summary, DFOL is a powerful logical formalism for representing and reasoning about distributed knowledge bases, and provides a sound and complete calculus for deriving new formulas from given ones. It has a wide range of applications in areas such as information integration, peer-to-peer data management, and ontology alignment, and can be used to integrate and align multiple knowledge bases."}

{"md5": "703a3788e110e2abb98b658fb02b7cef", "answer": "To perform sentiment analysis using the BERT model, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load a pre-trained BERT model: You can start with a BERT model pre-trained on large text datasets and fine-tune it for sentiment analysis tasks.\n2. Preprocess the data: BERT requires specific data formatting, including special tokens like [CLS] (at the beginning of each input sentence) and [SEP] (at the end of each input sentence). Additionally, you need to encode the input data according to the BERT model's requirements.\n3. Fine-tune the model: Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on your sentiment analysis dataset. This involves adding a classification layer on top of the BERT model and training the model to predict sentiment labels.\n4. Train and evaluate the model: Split your dataset into training and validation sets to monitor and prevent overfitting. Train the model on the training set and periodically evaluate its performance on the validation set. Once the model's performance meets the requirements, you can evaluate it on the test set.\n5. Use the trained model for sentiment analysis: Use the trained BERT model to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text data.\n\nNote that BERT is a powerful language model, and fine-tuning it for sentiment analysis can achieve state-of-the-art results. However, the specific steps and details may vary depending on the library or framework you are using (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch)."}

AC Generation Process: The AC is first generated in a power plant through various types of power plants such as coal, hydro, nuclear, wind, and solar power plants.\n\n2. AC Step-up Process: The generated AC is then stepped up to a higher voltage using a step-up transformer to reduce current and minimize energy loss during transmission.\n\n3. AC Grid Transmission Process: The stepped-up AC is transmitted over long-distance high-voltage transmission lines, also known as the grid, to demand areas.\n\n4. AC Step-down Process: Once the AC reaches the demand areas, it is stepped down to a lower voltage using a step-down transformer to make it safe for household and industrial use.\n\n5. AC Utilization Process: Finally, the stepped-down AC is used by homes, businesses, and public facilities through wires, sockets, and other devices.\n\nThese steps ensure the efficient transmission and utilization of AC power from the power plant to the end-users."}

Bring the steak to room temperature and season it generously with salt and pepper about 30 minutes before cooking. Heat a cast-iron skillet or heavy-bottomed pan over high heat, then add a small amount of high smoke point oil and a bit of butter to enhance flavor. Sear the steak for 2-4 minutes per side, or until it reaches the desired level of doneness. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature, aiming for 46-52°C for rare, 52-57°C for medium-rare, 57-63°C for medium, and above 63°C for well-done.

{"md5": "eb327d6f2b56f2f7d7669abeee9cd803", "answer": "The training process of a neural network involves several steps:\n\n1. **Data Preparation**: The first step is to prepare the data that will be used to train the network. This includes collecting, preprocessing, and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.\n\n2. **Initialization**: The next step is to initialize the neural network's parameters, such as weights and biases. This can be done using various methods, such as random initialization or initialization using pre-trained models.\n\n3. **Forward Propagation**: During forward propagation, the input data flows through the network, and the output is calculated. This step is used to calculate the loss between the predicted output and the actual output.\n\n4. **Loss Calculation**: The loss between the predicted output and the actual output is calculated using a loss function, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy (CE).\n\n5. **Backward Propagation**: In this step, the error is propagated backwards through the network to calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to each parameter. This is done using the chain rule of calculus.\n\n6. **Weight Update**: The parameters of the network are updated using an optimization algorithm, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSProp, based on the gradients calculated during backward propagation.\n\n7. **Repeat**: Steps 3-6 are repeated for multiple iterations until the network converges or a stopping criterion is met.\n\n8. **Evaluation**: After training, the network is evaluated on the testing set to estimate its performance on unseen data.\n\n9. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The performance of the network can be improved by tuning hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, or number of hidden layers.\n\n10. **Model Selection**: The best model is selected based on its performance on the validation set, and it is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n11. **Deployment**: The trained model is deployed in a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions on new data.\n\n12. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: The performance of the model is continuously monitored, and it is updated or retrained as necessary to maintain its performance over time.\n\nThese steps are the general process for training a neural network. The specific details may vary depending on the type of network, the problem being solved, and the framework being used."}

This can be done using object detection algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) or SSD (Single Shot Detector), which can detect objects in real-time.\n3. **Object Localization**: Once the object is detected, use computer vision techniques to localize the object in the scene. This can be done using techniques such as SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) or object tracking algorithms.\n4. **Manipulation Planning**: With the object localized, use manipulation planning algorithms to plan the manipulation of the object. This can be done using techniques such as motion planning or trajectory planning.\n5. **Execution**: Finally, execute the planned manipulation using a robotic arm or other manipulation device.\n\nTo integrate NLP and computer vision techniques, the following steps can be taken:\n\n1. **Multimodal Fusion**: Fuse the text command with visual information from the scene to improve object recognition and localization.\n2. **Knowledge Graphs**: Use knowledge graphs to represent the relationships between objects, actions, and scenes, allowing for more effective object recognition and manipulation.\n3. **Transfer Learning**: Use transfer learning to adapt pre-trained models to new scenes and objects, improving the robustness and generalizability of the system.\n4. **Human-Robot Interaction**: Design the system to interact with humans, allowing them to provide feedback and correct the system's understanding of the scene and objects.\n\nBy integrating NLP and computer vision techniques, a robust and flexible system can be developed that can recognize and manipulate objects based on user text commands, enabling a wide range of applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and human-robot interaction."}

{"md5": "7fee26def6fde2de28e2b40dfd5577af", "answer": "To master the correct shooting posture, follow these steps:\n\n1. Correct shooting posture while facing the basket: Ensure your entire body is facing the basket when shooting, aligning your toes, knees, hips, and shoulders with the hoop.\n2. Correct shooting posture while holding the ball: When holding the basketball, place the ball on the bones between your palm and fingers, using your fingers (rather than your palm) to control the ball.\n3. Correct shooting posture while swinging your arm: Raise your shooting arm to form a 90-degree angle with the ground, lifting the basketball above your eyebrows. This is a key motion for proper shooting posture.\n4. Correct shooting posture while jumping for the shot: Jump up forcefully while pushing the ball towards the basket, maintaining wrist flexibility to transfer the power of your swing to the basketball.\n5. Correct shooting posture while shooting: Release the ball at the top of your shooting motion, following through with your shooting hand and landing softly on both feet.\n6. Correct shooting posture while landing steadily: After jumping for the shot, try to land where you jumped to maintain body balance, which is crucial for sustaining proper shooting posture.\n7. Practice consistently: Regular practice will help you develop muscle memory and improve your shooting technique. Start with short distances and gradually increase the range as you build strength and confidence.\n8. Focus on proper footwork: A good shooting posture begins with proper footwork. Make sure your feet are shoulder-width apart, with your dominant foot forward and your body balanced evenly.\n9. Keep your eyes on the rim: Focus on the rim and the back of the net to help guide your shot and improve your accuracy.\n10. Follow through with your shooting hand: As you release the ball, follow through with your shooting hand, keeping your wrist straight and your fingers spread.\n11. Land softly: After jumping for the shot, try to land softly on both feet, with your knees bent to absorb the impact and maintain balance.\n\nRemember, mastering the correct shooting posture takes time and practice.

{"md5": "28eaf128f72d8750db5e06f5372d488b", "answer": "The backpropagation algorithm is a key component of neural network training, responsible for minimizing the error between the network's predictions and the actual outputs. Here's a step-by-step explanation of its role:\n\n1. **Error calculation**: The algorithm starts by calculating the error between the network's predictions and the actual outputs. This error is typically measured using a loss function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy.\n2. **Backward pass**: The error is then propagated backwards through the network, adjusting the weights and biases of each layer to minimize the error. This process is called the backward pass.\n3. **Gradient calculation**: During the backward pass, the algorithm calculates the gradient of the error with respect to each weight and bias. The gradient represents the rate of change of the error with respect to each parameter.\n4. **Weight update**: The algorithm then updates the weights and biases using the gradients and an optimization algorithm, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam. The goal is to minimize the error by adjusting the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient.\n5. **Repeat**: Steps 1-4 are repeated for multiple iterations, with the algorithm refining its predictions and adjusting the weights and biases until convergence or a stopping criterion is reached.\n\nThe backpropagation algorithm is essential for training neural networks, as it allows the network to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time. By iteratively adjusting the weights and biases, the algorithm minimizes the error and enables the network to make accurate predictions."}

{"md5": "943f0cbe78aeb4379b04bd8f145e7205", "answer": "Its decor was a sight to behold. A campy 1930's-esque sign featuring a cartoon horse and the bold letters \"The Derby\" eventually fell off the side of the building after two decades, but its memory will be dancing in my brain forever. The walls inside were adorned with old-timey boxing posters, and at one point, there was even a photo of Clark Gable riding a horse in the place. It was the type of spot where TKO's and big bands played. As a 19-year-old kid, the Derby represented everything I loved about the world of swing: its carefree defiance of grunge flannel, its embracing of classic American culture and most importantly – its hot girls dressed up as pin-ups.\n\nWhen I began noticing that the hottest club in Los Angeles had closed up shop sometime in early 2008, I was not that surprised. The Derby had been on a steady decline since the late 90's when mainstream media hijacked the swing movement, exploiting it for every last penny it could get. Just like the \"Macarena\" and frosted tips, it was bound to fizzle out.\n\nThe last time I visited the abandoned hulk in early 2009, I met up with an old friend for a photo shoot in front of the building. I was lugging my equipment and he was twirling his lasso for some Wild West themed photos we were taking in front of the old sign. As we took our snapshots, he mentioned that he had heard some rumor that the location was going to be resurrected into something totally different. My reaction was not exactly one of optimism, as I said something like, \"What are they gonna do, turn it into a bank?\" We laughed and laughed and decided it was the most ridiculous idea in the world. Ha!\n\nFast forward a few months into 2010, and I found myself driving down Los Feliz Boulevard not far from the Derby in my trusty old BMW. As I approached the building, what did I see? Only one of the most futile and depressing sights of the past few years: a sign that read, \"Now a Chase Bank\" sitting happily above the entrance. I thought I was hallucinating. When did banks start moving into old swing clubs? Do they have ATM's hidden behind the bar that used to serve White Russians and Sidecars? Do they offer.interfaces)? deposits and withdrawals for those who still know how to dance the Lindy Hop?\n\nAs I sat in the drive-thru a few weeks later, I asked the Chase Bank teller how they had acquired the location.\n\n\"So, um, how did the bank end up here?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm not really sure,\" she replied. \"I guess the building was foreclosed on or something.\"\n\n\"Foreclosed on? But this was the Derby! One of the most famous swing clubs in Los Angeles!\"\n\nThe teller looked at me, confused.\n\n\"Oh, really? Ha – I had no idea… I've only worked here a few weeks, so.\"\n\nI shook my head, wondering how fast America forgets. One day, the Derby is the place to be. The next, it's a sterile, impersonal bank filled with fluorescent lights and bad coffee. With my bank woes behind me, I took off into the L.A. traffic, wondering what other hidden gems and beloved locations will fall in the name of progress. Only time will tell.\n\nEpilogue: I heard through the grapevine that the sign in front of the bank still reads in small letters underneath the word \"Chase:\" \"Est. 1938.\" Oh, the Derby. May you someday, somehow be revived in our hearts.\n\n**Watch Zach's Music Video for his song Datura below**\n\nChase Bank credit crisis Derby foreclosure Los Angeles Music Rat Pack Remarks swing dance The Derby youtube Zach Selwyn"}

{"md5": "f985a75a5ad85d7952d81e5ce21de24a", "answer": "构建并训练一个用于股票价格预测的神经网络需要经过以下步骤：\n\n1. **数据收集**：首先，需要收集股票价格历史数据，并可能包括与股票价格相关的其他变量（例如市场索引、经济指标等），以便为训练神经网络模型提供必要的信息。\n2. **数据预处理**：在收集了股票价格相关数据之后，你需要对这些数据进行预处理，这可能包括数据清理（处理缺失值、异常值等），数据标准化（将数据转化为均值为 0，标准差为 1 的形式，使不同的特征可以在相同的尺度上进行比较），以及其他形式的数据转换（例如对于时间序列数据，可能需要提取出一些统计特性，例如趋势、季节性等），以适应神经网络的输入需求。\n3. **设计适用于股票价格预测的神经网络结构**：根据股票价格预测任务的特性选择合适的神经网络结构。例如，对于时间序列预测任务（如股票价格预测），一种常用的神经网络结构是循环神经网络（RNN）以及其变体（如长短期记忆网络 LSTM，门控循环单元 GRU 等）。\n4. **针对股票价格预测的神经网络训练**：然后可以使用随机梯度下降或一个更高级的优化算法来训练神经网络。在训练过程中，你需要一个损失函数（比如 mean squared error）来度量预测股票价格和真实价格之间的误差。通过最小化这个损失函数，神经网络学习到对于给定的输入数据，应该输出什么样的预测值。\n5. **模型验证和调整**：训练完成后，你需要对模型进行验证，观察其在未见过的测试数据集上的表现，根据效果对模型进行调整，例如改变神经网络的结构，调整模型的参数等，以提高股票价格预测的准确性。\n6. **部署适用于股票价格预测的模型**：模型训练完成并进行过验证后，就可以利用该模型进行股票价格的预测了，从而为投资决策提供参考依据。\n\n总的来说，构建并训练一个用于股票价格预测的神经网络需要仔细的数据处理、合理的模型设计和有效的训练过程。同时，需要注意到股票价格预测是一个复杂的任务，受到许多不可预测因素的影响，因此模型的预测结果应该作为参考，而不是唯一的决策依据。"}
