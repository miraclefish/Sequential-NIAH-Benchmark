Quando indagados a dizer de forma espont\u00e2nea a sua cor ou ra\u00e7a, 49% dos entrevistados se disseram brancos, 21,7% morenos, 13,6% pardos, 7,8% negros, 1,5% amarelos, 1,4% pretos, 0,4% ind\u00edgenas e 4,6% deram outras respostas. Por\u00e9m, quando a op\u00e7\u00e3o \"afrodescendente\" foi apresentada, 21,5% dos entrevistados se identificaram como tal. Quando a op\u00e7\u00e3o \"negro\" tamb\u00e9m foi apresentada, 27,8% dos entrevistados se identificaram com ela.\n\nConceito de afro-brasileiro \nO antrop\u00f3logo Darcy Ribeiro considerava o contingente negro e mulato \"o mais brasileiro dos componentes do nosso povo\" uma vez que, desafricanizado pela escravid\u00e3o e n\u00e3o sendo ind\u00edgena nem branco reinol, s\u00f3 restava a ele assumir uma identidade plenamente brasileira. Isto n\u00e3o quer dizer que negros e mulatos tenham se integrado \u00e0 sociedade brasileira sem serem estigmatizados. Muito pelo contr\u00e1rio, muitos brasileiros desenvolveram vergonha das suas origens negras, seja pelo fato de que descender de escravos remete a um passado de humilha\u00e7\u00f5es e sofrimentos que deveria ser esquecido ou pelos estere\u00f3tipos negativos que foram constru\u00eddos em torno da negritude, associando-a a mazelas sociais como a pobreza e a criminalidade.\n\nPortanto, assumir-se negro no Brasil sempre foi muito dif\u00edcil, por todo o conte\u00fado ideol\u00f3gico anti-negro que historicamente se desenvolveu no pa\u00eds, onde ainda hoje impera a ideologia do branqueamento e um padr\u00e3o branco-europeu est\u00e9tico e cultural. Portanto, no Brasil, apenas as pessoas de pele preta retinta s\u00e3o consideradas negras, sendo que o mulato j\u00e1 \u00e9 pardo e portanto meio-branco e, se tiver a pele um pouco mais clara, passa a ser visto como branco. No passado, era raro o mulato saltar para o lado negro de sua dupla natureza uma vez que, diante da massa de negros afundados na mis\u00e9ria, com eles n\u00e3o queria se confundir.\n\nNos \u00faltimos anos, contudo, cada vez mais brasileiros se assumem como negros. Isso \u00e9 consequ\u00eancia do sucesso dos negros americanos, vistos pelos brasileiros como uma \"vit\u00f3ria da ra\u00e7a\" e, principalmente, devido \u00e0 ascens\u00e3o social de parcela da popula\u00e7\u00e3o afrodescendente que, tendo acesso \u00e0 educa\u00e7\u00e3o e a melhores oportunidades de emprego, deixa de ter vergonha de assumir a sua cor.\n\nRa\u00e7a \u00e9 um conceito social, pol\u00edtico e ideol\u00f3gico, n\u00e3o tendo uma sustenta\u00e7\u00e3o biol\u00f3gica, uma vez que n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel separar biologicamente seres humanos em ra\u00e7as distintas. Em um pa\u00eds profundamente miscigenado como o Brasil, n\u00e3o \u00e9 f\u00e1cil definir quem \u00e9 negro, uma vez que muitos brasileiros, aparentemente brancos, s\u00e3o parcialmente descendentes de africanos, assim como muitos negros s\u00e3o parcialmente descendentes de europeus. Acrescenta-se a isso o grande n\u00famero de pardos, cuja classifica\u00e7\u00e3o racial pode ser bastante amb\u00edgua. A atriz Camila Pitanga autodeclara-se negra mas, em uma pesquisa do Datafolha, apenas 27% dos entrevistados classificaram a atriz como de cor preta (36% disseram que ela \u00e9 parda). O jogador Ronaldo Fen\u00f4meno, por sua vez, disse em uma entrevista que se considera branco, mas, segundo a mesma pesquisa, 64% dos brasileiros o consideram preto ou pardo, e somente 23% como branco. O ex-presidente Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva foi classificado como pardo por 42% dos entrevistados, ao passo que o ex-presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso, que j\u00e1 disse ser \"mulatinho\", foi classificado como branco por 70%, como pardo por 17% e como preto por 1%. A atriz Ta\u00eds Ara\u00fajo, autodeclarada negra, \u00e9 vista como tal por apenas 54%.\n\nPara o Movimento Negro, s\u00e3o consideradas negras todas as pessoas que t\u00eam essa \"apar\u00eancia\". Para o antrop\u00f3logo Kabegele Munanga, da USP, a quest\u00e3o \u00e9 problem\u00e1tica e, segundo ele, deve prevalecer a autoclassifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Portanto, se uma pessoa, aparentemente branca, se declara negra e se candidata a uma vaga com base em cotas raciais, a sua decis\u00e3o deve ser respeitada.\n\nEm 2007, um caso pol\u00eamico chamou a aten\u00e7\u00e3o da m\u00eddia brasileira: dois irm\u00e3os, g\u00eameos id\u00eanticos, concorreram no vestibular da UnB sob o sistema de cotas. Na universidade havia uma banca que, ap\u00f3s analisar as fotos dos candidatos, definia quem era negro e quem n\u00e3o era. Ap\u00f3s terem suas fotos analisadas pela banca, um dos g\u00eameos foi considerado negro, e o outro n\u00e3o. O soci\u00f3logo Dem\u00e9trio Magnoli considera perigoso a instaura\u00e7\u00e3o de \"tribunais raciais\" no Brasil, o que aproximaria o pa\u00eds das na\u00e7\u00f5es racialistas e paranoicas do s\u00e9culo passado. Em 1933, a Alemanha nazista definiu como judeu aquele que tinha ao menos um quarto de \"sangue judaico\" (equivalente a um av\u00f4). Em 1935, o pr\u00f3prio Hitler alteraria a regra, e passou-se a considerar como judeu somente quem tinha mais de dois ter\u00e7os de \"sangue judaico\", sendo alem\u00e3es os \"meio-judeus\" (ou seja, com apenas dois av\u00f3s judeus). Nos Estados Unidos sob as Leis de Jim Crow, era considerada negra qualquer pessoa com uma gota de sangue africano (one-drop rule), mesmo que n\u00e3o aparentasse s\u00ea-la. Na \u00c1frica do Sul do Apartheid, quando havia d\u00favida sobre a negritude da pessoa, era feito o \"teste do pente\": se o pente enroscasse no cabelo, a pessoa era negra, e se o pente deslizasse at\u00e9 o ch\u00e3o, era branca.\n\nNo censo do IBGE de 2010, 7,6% dos brasileiros identificaram sua cor ou ra\u00e7a como preta, 43,1% como parda e 47,7% como branca. Esses dados, contudo, devem ser analisados com cautela, haja vista a hist\u00f3rica tend\u00eancia ao branqueamento que se observa nas classifica\u00e7\u00f5es raciais no pa\u00eds. Frequentemente, textos acad\u00eamicos e jornal\u00edsticos classificam como popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra a soma dos pretos e pardos - o IBGE, por\u00e9m, n\u00e3o adota essa classifica\u00e7\u00e3o. Essa metodologia \u00e9 questionada por alguns, uma vez que a maioria dos pardos s\u00e3o mesti\u00e7os, que n\u00e3o se identificam nem como negros, nem como brancos, mas como um grupo separado. Al\u00e9m disso, muitos pardos n\u00e3o s\u00e3o descendentes de africanos, mas de \u00edndios, principalmente nos estados do Norte.\n\nO Estado brasileiro, que historicamente assumiu diversas atitudes claramente racistas, como no final do , quando proibiu a entrada de imigrantes africanos e asi\u00e1ticos no pa\u00eds, ao mesmo tempo em que promovia a entrada de imigrantes europeus,\nrecentemente tem se redimido e tomado atitudes pol\u00edticas que visam a melhora das condi\u00e7\u00f5es de vida da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra, tanto do ponto de vista s\u00f3cio-econ\u00f4mico como ideol\u00f3gico. Dentre as quais, a Lei n.\u00ba 10.639 de 2003, que tornou obrigat\u00f3rio o ensino da Hist\u00f3ria da \u00c1frica e da cultura afro-brasileira nas escolas, a Lei n.\u00ba 12.288 de 2010, que instituiu o Estatuto da Igualdade Racial, a Lei n.\u00ba 12.519 de 2011, que instituiu o Dia Nacional de Zumbi e da Consci\u00eancia Negra, a Lei n.\u00ba 12.711 de 2012, que tornou obrigat\u00f3ria a reserva de cotas raciais no Ensino Superior e a Lei n.\u00ba 12.990 de 2014, que tamb\u00e9m tornou obrigat\u00f3ria a reserva de cotas para negros nos concursos p\u00fablicos.\n\nHist\u00f3ria\n\nA escravid\u00e3o no mundo \n\nSegundo o historiador Orlando Patterson, praticamente n\u00e3o existe ser humano que n\u00e3o seja descendente de escravos ou de senhores de escravos. A escravid\u00e3o foi adotada em diversas sociedades humanas, em diferentes regi\u00f5es do mundo, vigorando nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es mais primitivas at\u00e9 as civiliza\u00e7\u00f5es mais sofisticadas.\n\nNo que viria a ser o Brasil, a escravid\u00e3o j\u00e1 era praticada pelos \u00edndios, na sua forma mais primitiva, bem antes da chegada dos europeus. Entre os tupinamb\u00e1s, a escravid\u00e3o n\u00e3o tinha um valor econ\u00f4mico, vez que os cativos serviam para serem exibidos como trof\u00e9us de valor militar e honra ou como carne a ser devorada em rituais canibalescos que poderiam acontecer at\u00e9 quinze anos ap\u00f3s a captura.\n\nPesquisas arqueol\u00f3gicas mostram que a escravid\u00e3o foi praticada na Europa pelo menos desde o Neol\u00edtico. Com a revolu\u00e7\u00e3o urbana, iniciada a partir do V mil\u00eanio a. C., os prisioneiros de guerra, no lugar de serem sacrificados em cerim\u00f4nias antropof\u00e1gicas, passaram a ser usados como trabalhadores cativos. O sistema escravista alcan\u00e7ou seu auge entre os europeus nas civiliza\u00e7\u00f5es grega e romana, \u00e9poca em que milhares de pessoas foram traficadas como escravas no Mar Negro e no Mediterr\u00e2neo. A maioria desses escravos eram europeus, embora tamb\u00e9m viessem das col\u00f4nias na \u00c1frica e na \u00c1sia. A escravid\u00e3o declinou no norte da Europa no fim da Idade M\u00e9dia, por\u00e9m persistiu no sul at\u00e9 a Idade Moderna.\n\nEntre os povos mais primitivos da \u00c1frica Subsaariana, assim como entre os \u00edndios do Brasil, os escravos raramente tinham um valor econ\u00f4mico, sendo s\u00edmbolo de prest\u00edgio. Por\u00e9m, a medida que os povos subsaarianos mais simples passaram a ter contato com povos mais avan\u00e7ados, os escravos geralmente constitu\u00edam a \u00fanica mercadoria que eles poderiam oferecer em troca de bens de luxo. Em 1580 a.C, navios j\u00e1 partiam do Egito para a Somalil\u00e2ndia com o \u00fanico objetivo de capturar escravos. Com o avan\u00e7o do islamismo na Pen\u00ednsula Ar\u00e1bica e no Norte da \u00c1frica, o tr\u00e1fico de escravos negros se intensificou, com a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de postos comerciais na \u00c1frica oriental por comerciantes \u00e1rabes. No in\u00edcio da Idade M\u00e9dia, traficantes \u00e1rabes penetraram a \u00c1frica ocidental e iniciaram o tr\u00e1fico transaariano de escravos, que culminou na escraviza\u00e7\u00e3o de milh\u00f5es de africanos negros que foram mandados para as regi\u00f5es islamizadas do norte da \u00c1frica e para os pa\u00edses \u00e1rabes.\n\nO tr\u00e1fico transatl\u00e2ntico de escravos \n\nNenhum continente foi t\u00e3o afetado pela escravid\u00e3o como a \u00c1frica. O \u00faltimo e o maior sistema escravista da Hist\u00f3ria da humanidade foi o tr\u00e1fico de africanos para as Am\u00e9ricas. Praticamente todos os povos da Europa ocidental estiveram envolvidos nesse altamente lucrativo tr\u00e1fico, embora Portugal, Holanda, Inglaterra e Fran\u00e7a se tenham destacado. Com a chegada dos europeus ao continente africano no , o tr\u00e1fico de escravos, intenso h\u00e1 v\u00e1rios s\u00e9culos, cresceu ainda mais. Em troca de mercadoria e dinheiro oferecidos pelos comerciantes europeus, v\u00e1rios povos africanos venderam pessoas de tribos vizinhas para os traficantes de pessoas.\n\nComo resultado do est\u00edmulo econ\u00f4mico advindo do com\u00e9rcio de escravos, surgiram na \u00c1frica Estados centralizados cuja economia estava fortemente dependente da venda de escravos, como Daom\u00e9 e o Imp\u00e9rio Axante. Neste processo, os comerciantes europeus e a elite africana lucravam por meio da escraviza\u00e7\u00e3o de milh\u00f5es de africanos. De maneira geral, havia oito meios pelos quais as pessoas poderiam ser escravizadas:\n\n Captura em guerras;\n Rapto;\n Pagamento de tributos e impostos;\n D\u00edvida;\n Puni\u00e7\u00e3o por crimes;\n Abandono e venda de crian\u00e7as;\n Auto-escraviza\u00e7\u00e3o;\n Nascimento\n\nA maioria dos africanos chegou \u00e0s Am\u00e9ricas por meio de rapto, ou seja, foram v\u00edtimas de ataques e incurs\u00f5es feitas com o \u00fanico prop\u00f3sito de se adquirir escravos. A maioria dos raptos eram feitos por intermedi\u00e1rios africanos, que penetravam tribos vizinhas e vendiam os seus membros aos europeus embora, em muitos casos, os raptos fossem feitos pessoalmente pelos portugueses. A segunda forma mais comum da escraviza\u00e7\u00e3o foi por meio de capturas em guerras. Prisioneiros de guerra eram reduzidos \u00e0 escravid\u00e3o pela tribo vencedora e destinados \u00e0 escravid\u00e3o nas Am\u00e9ricas. Rapto e captura em guerras n\u00e3o devem ser confundidos pois, no primeiro caso, a tribo \u00e9 atacada com o \u00fanico objetivo de se obter escravos e, no segundo, a tribo \u00e9 escravizada como consequ\u00eancia de ter sucumbido na guerra. Patterson estima que, dos 1,6 milh\u00e3o de africanos entrados no Novo Mundo antes do final do , 60% podem ter sido prisioneiros de guerra, enquanto menos de um ter\u00e7o foi raptado. Por\u00e9m, dos 7,4 milh\u00f5es entrados entre 1701 e 1810, 70% foram raptados e 20% foram v\u00edtimas de guerra.\n\nPor que os africanos?\n\nDe fato, teria sido muito mais barato aos europeus obter escravos na pr\u00f3pria Europa do que enviar navios para a costa africana, com o objetivo de capturar m\u00e3o de obra. Para os europeus, o grupo de indiv\u00edduos eleg\u00edveis para a escravid\u00e3o era muito mais restrito do que para os africanos. A expans\u00e3o ultramarina colocou os europeus em contato com povos \"que diferiam mais deles, cultural e fisicamente, do que qualquer outro povo com o qual eles tinham interagido no mil\u00eanio anterior\". Na Europa, a hip\u00f3tese de escravizar outros europeus nunca foi levantada, ao passo que, na \u00c1frica, havia grupos africanos dispostos a vender outros africanos para serem escravizados. Assim, a principal causa para a escraviza\u00e7\u00e3o em massa de africanos foi \"um descompasso entre as concep\u00e7\u00f5es africana e europeia a respeito da elegibilidade para a escraviza\u00e7\u00e3o, em cujas ra\u00edzes encontram-se a cultura, as normas sociais, que n\u00e3o est\u00e3o claramente ligadas \u00e0 economia\".  Segundo o historiador David Eltis, \"A \u00c1frica era uma massa continental muito maior, que abrigava mais diversidade de popula\u00e7\u00f5es humanas do que se poderia encontrar em qualquer outra \u00e1rea de tamanho compar\u00e1vel no mundo. N\u00e3o \u00e9 de estranhar que os africanos n\u00e3o tivessem uma concep\u00e7\u00e3o continental de pertencimento \u2014 isto \u00e9, de povos que n\u00e3o se podia escravizar\".\n\nConcomitantemente, no Continente Americano, os povos amer\u00edndios estavam morrendo aos milhares e o n\u00famero de colonos europeus dispostos a cruzar o Atl\u00e2ntico era muito pequeno. Assim, os colonizadores buscaram na \u00c1frica a m\u00e3o de obra necess\u00e1ria para desenvolver as col\u00f4nias.\n\nA escravid\u00e3o no Brasil \n\nO Brasil recebeu cerca de 38% de todos os escravos africanos que foram trazidos para a Am\u00e9rica. A quantidade total de africanos subsaarianos que chegaram ao Brasil tem estimativas muito variadas: alguns citam mais de tr\u00eas milh\u00f5es de pessoas, outros quatro milh\u00f5es. Segundo uma estimativa, de 1501 a 1866, foram embarcados na \u00c1frica com destino ao Brasil 5.532.118 africanos, dos quais 4.864.374 chegaram vivos (667.696 pessoas morreram nos navios negreiros durante o trajeto \u00c1frica-Brasil). O Brasil foi, de longe, o pa\u00eds que mais recebeu escravos no mundo. Em compara\u00e7\u00e3o, no mesmo per\u00edodo, com destino \u00e0 Am\u00e9rica do Norte foram embarcados 472.381 africanos, dos quais 388.747 chegaram vivos (83.634 n\u00e3o sobreviveram).\n\nDe acordo com a estimativa do IBGE, o n\u00famero total de africanos que chegou ao Brasil foi de 4.009.400.\n\nOs portugueses lideraram o tr\u00e1fico de escravos por s\u00e9culos. Herdaram da tradi\u00e7\u00e3o isl\u00e2mica sua cultura t\u00e9cnica, fundamentalmente para a navega\u00e7\u00e3o, produ\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facar e incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de negros escravos para a for\u00e7a de trabalho. A m\u00e3o de obra escrava de africanos na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de a\u00e7\u00facar j\u00e1 estava sendo utilizada nas ilhas atl\u00e2nticas da Madeira e dos A\u00e7ores \u00e0 \u00e9poca do descobrimento do Brasil, seguindo uma nova forma de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o de produ\u00e7\u00e3o: a fazenda. No in\u00edcio do , cerca de 10% da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Lisboa era composta por escravos africanos, n\u00famero surpreendentemente alto para um contexto europeu. Os portugueses, mais do que qualquer outro povo europeu, estavam culturalmente condicionados a lidar com povos de pele mais escura e preparados para contingenciar ind\u00edgenas ao trabalho for\u00e7ado e a aliciar multid\u00f5es de africanos com o intuito de viabilizar seus interesses econ\u00f4micos. O Brasil se configurou como uma forma\u00e7\u00e3o colonial-escravista de car\u00e1ter agromercantil. Primeiramente, o portugu\u00eas usou do trabalho for\u00e7ado do ind\u00edgena. Por\u00e9m, com a deteriora\u00e7\u00e3o dessa popula\u00e7\u00e3o abor\u00edgene, o tr\u00e1fico de pessoas oriundas da \u00c1frica se intensificou gradativamente, passando a compor a massa de trabalhadores no Brasil.\n\nA escravid\u00e3o fincou ra\u00edzes profundas na sociedade brasileira. Os africanos e seus descendentes resistiram durante todos os s\u00e9culos contra a escravatura, por meio de rebeli\u00f5es ou fugas, formando quilombos. Por\u00e9m, possuir escravos era uma pr\u00e1tica t\u00e3o disseminada e aceita pela sociedade que muitos ex-escravos, ap\u00f3s conseguirem a liberdade, tamb\u00e9m tratavam de adquirir um cativo para si. Ter escravos significava status e afastava as pessoas do mundo do trabalho pesado, que na mentalidade brasileira apenas os escravos podiam exercer. Portanto, no Brasil escravagista, ningu\u00e9m se espantava ao ver um negro ou um mulato comprando um escravo, mas essa cena seria chocante nos Estados Unidos \u00e0 \u00e9poca e dif\u00edcil de ser imaginada pelos brasileiros atualmente. Toda a vida econ\u00f4mica do imp\u00e9rio ultramarino portugu\u00eas na \u00c1frica e na Am\u00e9rica se organizava com base no trabalho escravo, e o sentimento abolicionista sempre foi muito d\u00e9bil no mundo luso-brasileiro. Em decorr\u00eancia, o Brasil s\u00f3 extinguiu o tr\u00e1fico de escravos em 1850, sob press\u00e3o da Inglaterra e ap\u00f3s desrespeitar acordos nos quais se comprometia a abolir o tr\u00e1fico. A escravatura s\u00f3 foi abolida em territ\u00f3rio brasileiro em 1888, sendo o Brasil o \u00faltimo pa\u00eds das Am\u00e9ricas a abolir a escravid\u00e3o. A escravatura era um dos pilares do Imp\u00e9rio do Brasil e, com a aboli\u00e7\u00e3o, o imperador  perdeu o apoio dos fazendeiros escravistas insatisfeitos por n\u00e3o terem recebido indeniza\u00e7\u00e3o, sendo uma das causas da queda da Monarquia no Brasil.\n\nFluxos imigrat\u00f3rios\n\nRotas do tr\u00e1fico entre Brasil e \u00c1frica \n\nO projeto The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database estimou que, durante o tr\u00e1fico negreiro, desembarcaram no Brasil 5.099.816 africanos. Ap\u00f3s minuciosas an\u00e1lises na \u00c1frica e nas Am\u00e9ricas, os pesquisadores conseguiram tra\u00e7ar as origens dos africanos trazidos ao Brasil. Cerca de 68% dos escravos desembarcados no Brasil eram provenientes do Centro-Oeste africano. Atualmente, situam-se nessa regi\u00e3o os Estados de Angola, Rep\u00fablica do Congo e Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica do Congo.\n\nCada \u00e9poca da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil tem diferentes portos importantes de embarque de escravos, e cada porto recebia escravos provenientes de uma grande regi\u00e3o que ia centenas de quil\u00f4metros dentro do interior da \u00c1frica. Portanto, a origem \u00e9tnica dos escravos recebidos no Brasil \u00e9 muito variada, al\u00e9m de se ter alterado ao longo dos s\u00e9culos de tr\u00e1fico negreiro.\n\nUm fator essencial para a compreens\u00e3o das regi\u00f5es de origem dos africanos trazidos para o Brasil est\u00e1 nos ventos e correntes mar\u00edtimas do Atl\u00e2ntico Norte e do Atl\u00e2ntico Sul. Existem dois sistemas de ventos e de correntes mar\u00edtimas nos Atl\u00e2nticos (que atuam como \"rodas-gigantes\"): um ao norte do equador e gira no sentido hor\u00e1rio; o outro, ao sul, gira no sentido anti-hor\u00e1rio. Esses ventos e correntes foram determinantes para que os escravos levados para a Am\u00e9rica do Norte e o Caribe fossem origin\u00e1rios sobretudo das \u00e1reas mais setentrionais da \u00c1frica subsaariana, ao passo que, para o Brasil, foram trazidos principalmente africanos das partes mais ao sul, predominantemente de Angola, enquanto que o sudeste da \u00c1frica e o golfo do Benim desempenharam pap\u00e9is secund\u00e1rios.\n\nApesar disto, os grupos \u00e9tnicos acabaram se dividindo por locais, com preponder\u00e2ncia dos Bantos no Rio de Janeiro e dos escravos oeste-africanos na Bahia e norte do Brasil. Uma das raz\u00f5es foi o momento hist\u00f3rico em que ocorreu cada ciclo econ\u00f4mico em uma regi\u00e3o diferente do Brasil (a\u00e7\u00facar no nordeste, ouro em Minas Gerais e caf\u00e9 no Rio de Janeiro) e a oferta maior de escravos em uma regi\u00e3o da \u00c1frica\n\nDe modo simplificado, podemos dizer que os escravos africanos trazidos para o Brasil originavam-se nos seguintes locais de embarque:\n Oeste-Africano: portos do Senegal e G\u00e2mbia (em menor escala, a ilha de Gor\u00e9e), Mina (hoje Elmina) em Gana, Uid\u00e1 em Benim e Calabar na Nig\u00e9ria;\n Centro-oeste Africano: portos de Cabinda (pr\u00f3ximo a foz do rio Congo) e Luanda, ambos na atual Angola;\n Leste Africano: portos de Ibo, Louren\u00e7o Marques e Inhambane em Mo\u00e7ambique; portos de Zanzibar e Quiloa na atual Tanz\u00e2nia.\n\nQuanto \u00e0s fases de imigra\u00e7\u00e3o, segundo a periodiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Viana Filho, s\u00e3o definidos:\n\n o ciclo da Guin\u00e9 (s\u00e9culos XVI e XVII): portos do Senegal e G\u00e2mbia (em menor escala, a ilha de Gor\u00e9e) enviando escravos \"sudaneses\" (ou oeste-africanos, negros da Guin\u00e9) principalmente para Recife e Salvador;\n o ciclo de Angola (): Portos de Mina, Uid\u00e1, Calabar; Cabinda  e Luanda; e Zanzibar, enviando escravos bantos que eram desembarcados principalmente em Salvador e Rio de Janeiro, de onde a maior parte ia para Minas Gerais;\n o ciclo da Costa da Mina (-1815): Portos de Mina, Uid\u00e1 e Calabar; Cabinda  e Luanda; Zanzibar e Quiloa; Ibo, Louren\u00e7o Marques e Inhambane enviando escravos \"sudaneses\" e islamizados que eram desembarcados principalmente em Salvador e Rio de Janeiro, de onde a maior parte seguia para as planta\u00e7\u00f5es de caf\u00e9 no vale do Para\u00edba do Sul e cana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar do norte fluminense;\n a fase da ilegalidade (1815-1831).\n\nNa primeira metade do , em que ocorreu o apogeu do tr\u00e1fico de escravos para o Brasil, os escravos do oeste-africano iam principalmente para Salvador, enquanto os centro-oeste e leste-africano iam principalmente para o Rio de Janeiro. A raz\u00e3o \u00e9 simplesmente a dist\u00e2ncia menor entre portos de embarque e desembarque, transportando uma carga que literalmente perecia com as m\u00e1s condi\u00e7\u00f5es da viagem. Deste modo, os grandes grupos \u00e9tnicos acabaram predominando em alguns locais como os bantos no Rio de Janeiro e os escravos oeste-africanos na Bahia e norte do Brasil. Minas Gerais foi um caso peculiar, pois recebeu grande quantidade de escravos oeste-africanos e bantos, sendo que os primeiros predominaram at\u00e9 meados do , e os segundos durante o XIX.\n\nRetorno \u00e0 \u00c1frica \nDiversas comunidades de escravos libertos no Brasil retornaram \u00e0 \u00c1frica entre os s\u00e9culos XVIII e XIX. Entre eles destacam-se os Tabom, retornados ao Gana em 1835-36, e os Agud\u00e1s ou Amar\u00f4s, no Benim (ver: Francisco F\u00e9lix de Sousa), no Togo e na Nig\u00e9ria. Numerosos, esses \"brasileiros\" estabeleceram-se na regi\u00e3o da antiga costa dos Escravos - que abrangia todo o golfo de Benim, indo da atual cidade de Lagos, na Nig\u00e9ria, at\u00e9 Acra, no Gana. Milton Guran em seu livro \"Agud\u00e1s \u2013 os \"brasileiros\" do Benim\" resume: \"Os \"brasileiros\" do Benim, Togo e Nig\u00e9ria, tamb\u00e9m conhecidos como agud\u00e1s, nas l\u00ednguas locais, s\u00e3o descendentes dos antigos escravos do Brasil que retornaram \u00e0 \u00c1frica durante o  e dos comerciantes baianos l\u00e1 estabelecidos nos s\u00e9culos XVIII e XIX. Possuem nomes de fam\u00edlia como Souza, Silva, Almeida, entre outros, festejam Nosso Senhor do Bonfim, dan\u00e7am a burrinha (uma forma arcaica do bumba-meu-boi), fazem desfiles de Carnaval e se re\u00fanem frequentemente em torno de uma feijoada ou de um kousidou. Ainda hoje \u00e9 comum os agud\u00e1s mais velhos se cumprimentarem com um sonoro \"Bom dia, como passou?\" \"Bem, 'brigado'\" \u00e9 a resposta.\"\n\nImigra\u00e7\u00e3o africana recente \nNas d\u00e9cadas recentes, africanos negros t\u00eam imigrado ao Brasil, especialmente de pa\u00edses que falam portugu\u00eas como Angola, Cabo Verde e S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe, em busca de oportunidades de trabalho ou comerciais. H\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m um expressivo n\u00famero de migrantes de pa\u00edses n\u00e3o-lus\u00f3fonos como Senegal, Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica do Congo, Togo e Nig\u00e9ria, mas a maioria vai para o pa\u00eds latino-americano em condi\u00e7\u00e3o de refugiados.\n\nGrupos \u00e9tnicos \n\nOs portugueses classificavam diversas etnias africanas de forma gen\u00e9rica, sem levar em conta as peculiaridades existentes entre esses diferentes grupos. De maneira geral, os escravos eram identificados de acordo com a regi\u00e3o do porto onde embarcaram. Em consequ\u00eancia, um grupo classificado como \u00fanico pelos portugueses poderia, de fato, abarcar diversas etnias dentro dele.\n\nEm termos gerais, pode-se classificar as culturas africanas vindas ao Brasil em tr\u00eas grandes grupos:\n as culturas \"sudanesas\": os iorub\u00e1s (\"nag\u00f4s\") da Nig\u00e9ria, os jejes de Daom\u00e9 (Benim), os fantes e axantes da Costa do Ouro (Gana), dentre outros;\n as culturas islamizadas: os fulas, os mandingas e os hau\u00e7\u00e1s, do norte da Nig\u00e9ria, chamados de negros mal\u00eas na Bahia e negros aluf\u00e1s no Rio de Janeiro;\n as culturas bantus: do Congo, Angola e Mo\u00e7ambique.\n\nOs oeste-africanos, oriundos da denominada Costa da Mina, sobretudo da atual Nig\u00e9ria e do Benim, eram genericamente denominados de escravos minas ou sudaneses, embora dentro desse grupo gen\u00e9rico eram inclu\u00eddas etnias diversas, como os nag\u00f4s, jejes, fantis e axantes, g\u00e1s e minas, mal\u00eas (islamizados), hau\u00e7\u00e1s, can\u00faris, nup\u00e9s, gurunsis, fulas e mandingas. Muitos dos escravos trazidos da Costa da Mina eram seguidores da religi\u00e3o mu\u00e7ulmana. Alguns deles sabiam ler e escrever em \u00e1rabe, fato inusitado no Brasil colonial, onde a maioria da popula\u00e7\u00e3o, inclusive a elite, era analfabeta. A influ\u00eancia isl\u00e2mica desses escravos pode ainda ser vista em Salvador, sobretudo no vestu\u00e1rio das baianas, com seu caracter\u00edstico turbante mu\u00e7ulmano, saias largas e compridas, xales e mantras listradas.\n\nO outro grande grupo que veio para o Brasil foi o dos bantos, a maioria oriunda de Angola, mas esse grupo inclu\u00eda tamb\u00e9m escravos de lugares long\u00ednquos, como Mo\u00e7ambique.\n\nBantus \nOs Bantus s\u00e3o descendentes de um grupo etnolingu\u00edstico que se espalhou r\u00e1pida e recentemente desde a atual regi\u00e3o de Camar\u00f5es em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao sul, atingindo tanto o litoral oeste quanto o leste da \u00c1frica. Como esta expans\u00e3o foi recente, as diferentes na\u00e7\u00f5es Bantus t\u00eam muitos aspectos \u00e9tnico-culturais, lingu\u00edsticos e gen\u00e9ticos em comum, apesar da grande \u00e1rea pela qual se espalharam.\n\nOs Bantus trazidos para o Brasil vieram das regi\u00f5es que atualmente s\u00e3o os pa\u00edses de Angola, Rep\u00fablica do Congo, Rep\u00fablica Democr\u00e1tica do Congo, Mo\u00e7ambique e, em menor escala, Tanz\u00e2nia. Pertenciam a grupos \u00e9tnicos que os traficantes dividiam em Cassangas, Benguelas, Cabindas, Dembos, Rebolos, Anjicos, Macuas, Quiloas, etc.\n\nConstitu\u00edram a maior parte dos escravos levados para o Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais e para a zona da mata do Nordeste.\n\nOeste-africanos \n\nOs oeste-africanos provinham de uma vasta regi\u00e3o litor\u00e2nea que ia desde o Senegal at\u00e9 \u00e0 Nig\u00e9ria, al\u00e9m do interior adjacente. A faixa de terra fronteiri\u00e7a ao sul da regi\u00e3o do Sahel, que se estende no sentido oeste-leste atravessando toda a \u00c1frica, \u00e9 denominada Sud\u00e3o. Frequentemente, os escravos de origem oeste-africana s\u00e3o chamados de sudaneses, o que causa confus\u00e3o com os habitantes do atual Sud\u00e3o, que comprovadamente n\u00e3o teve sua popula\u00e7\u00e3o escravizada nas Am\u00e9ricas. Al\u00e9m disto, apenas parte dos escravos de origem oeste-africana vieram da vasta regi\u00e3o chamada Sud\u00e3o. Os nativos do oeste-africano foram os primeiros escravos a serem levados para as Am\u00e9ricas sendo chamados, nesta \u00e9poca, de negros da Guin\u00e9.\n\nNo livro Di\u00e1logos das grandezas do Brasil, de 1610, Ambr\u00f3sio Fernandes Brand\u00e3o fala da abund\u00e2ncia de \"escravos da Guin\u00e9\" existente nas capitanias nordestinas.\n\n(...) porquanto neste Brasil se h\u00e1 criado um novo Guin\u00e9 com a grande multid\u00e3o d'escravos vindos de l\u00e1 que nele se acham; em tanto que, em algumas das capitanias, h\u00e1 mais deles que dos [\u00edndios] naturais da terra, e lodos os homens que nele vivem tem metida quase toda sua fazenda em semelhante mercadoria.\n\nOs oeste-africanos eram principalmente nativos das regi\u00f5es que atualmente s\u00e3o os pa\u00edses de Costa do Marfim, Benim, Togo, Gana e Nig\u00e9ria. A regi\u00e3o do golfo de Benim foi um dos principais pontos de embarque de escravos, tanto que era conhecida como Costa dos Escravos. Os oeste-africanos constitu\u00edram a maior parte dos escravos levados para a Bahia. Pertenciam a diversos grupos \u00e9tnicos que o tr\u00e1fico negreiro dividia, principalmente, em:\n Nag\u00f4s  - os que falavam ou entendiam a l\u00edngua dos Iorub\u00e1s, o que inclu\u00eda etnias como os  Queto, eb\u00e1s, Ebad\u00f3s, Sab\u00e9, etc;\n Jejes - que inclu\u00eda etnias como Fons, axantes, Eu\u00e9s, fantis, Mina e outros menores como Crus, Agni, Nzema, Timini, etc.\n\nOs Mal\u00eas eram escravos de origem oeste-africana, na maior parte falantes da l\u00edngua ha\u00fa\u00e7a, que seguiam a religi\u00e3o mu\u00e7ulmana. Muitos deles falavam e escreviam em l\u00edngua \u00e1rabe, ou usavam caracteres do \u00c1rabe para escrever em ha\u00fa\u00e7a. Al\u00e9m dos Hau\u00e7\u00e1s, isto \u00e9, dos falantes de l\u00edngua ha\u00fa\u00e7a, outras etnias islamizadas trazidas como escravos para o Brasil foram os Mandingas, Fulas, nup\u00e9s, Bornu, Gurunsi, etc.\n\nHavia tamb\u00e9m oeste-africanos de outras etnias al\u00e9m das acima citadas como os Ma\u00eds, Savalu e v\u00e1rios outros grupos menores.\n\nDemografia \n\nMuitos negros foram trazidos para o Brasil como escravos no per\u00edodo colonial e imperial e eram uma parcela grande da popula\u00e7\u00e3o, mas, o crescimento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra foi relativamente pequeno em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a entrada de escravos da \u00c1frica subsaariana. Primeiramente, porque os homens eram a grande maioria dos escravos traficados para o Brasil, atingindo quantidades at\u00e9 oito vezes maiores do que a de mulheres. Segundo, porque a mortalidade era muito maior entre os escravos do que entre o resto da popula\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira. Em certos momentos da Hist\u00f3ria do Brasil, o crescimento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o escrava deveu-se somente ao crescimento do tr\u00e1fico de escravos. Deve ser registrado que n\u00e3o h\u00e1 certeza quanto ao n\u00famero que entrou porque no Brasil n\u00e3o foi realizado censo da popula\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira antes de 1872. O que \u00e9 certo, por\u00e9m, \u00e9 que o n\u00famero de africanos trazidos foi grande, por\u00e9m, a maior parte deles era do sexo masculino, com expectativa de vida no geral muito baixa. Nas palavras de Auguste de Saint-Hilaire: \"Uma infinidade de negros morreu sem deixar descend\u00eancia\".\nTanto \u00e9 que a popula\u00e7\u00e3o inteira do Brasil, estimada em 4 milh\u00f5es por volta de 1823, abrangendo todos os segmentos da popula\u00e7\u00e3o (brancos, pardos e mesti\u00e7os em geral, africanos livres e escravos, e \u00edndios), corresponde ao n\u00famero total de africanos que, de acordo com alguns, teria vindo ao Brasil durante todo o per\u00edodo colonial, n\u00e3o se podendo dizer, ent\u00e3o, que o n\u00famero de africanos trazidos corresponda \u00e0quele que contribuiu, efetivamente, para o crescimento demogr\u00e1fico do pa\u00eds.\n\nA popula\u00e7\u00e3o negra cresceu com for\u00e7a com a melhoria de tratamento dos escravos que ocorreu depois do fim do tr\u00e1fico com a Lei Eus\u00e9bio de Queir\u00f3s de 1850. No primeiro levantamento sobre a cor da popula\u00e7\u00e3o feito no Brasil, em 1872, os resultados foram os seguintes: 4.188.737 pardos, 3.787.289 brancos e 1.954.452 pretos, sendo assim, os pretos eram o terceiro maior grupo, como ainda o s\u00e3o. No segundo levantamento feito, em 1890, houve um t\u00edmido aumento da popula\u00e7\u00e3o preta, os resultados foram os seguintes: 6.302.198 brancos, 5.934.291 pardos e 2.097.426 pretos, o que mostra que os pretos continuaram sendo o terceiro maior grupo da popula\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira naquela \u00e9poca mas que n\u00e3o tiveram o mesmo r\u00e1pido crescimento populacional que os brancos e pardos tiveram entre 1872 e 1890.\n\nOs escravos homens, jovens, mais fortes e saud\u00e1veis eram os mais valorizados. Havia um grande desequil\u00edbrio demogr\u00e1fico entre homens e mulheres na popula\u00e7\u00e3o de escravos. No per\u00edodo 1837-1840, os homens constitu\u00edam 73,7% e as mulheres apenas 26,3% da popula\u00e7\u00e3o escrava. Os navios negreiros embarcavam mais homens do que mulheres. Al\u00e9m disto, os donos de escravos n\u00e3o se preocupavam com a reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o natural da escravaria, porque era mais barato comprar escravos rec\u00e9m trazidos pelo tr\u00e1fico internacional do que gastar com a alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o de crian\u00e7as.  O n\u00famero de crian\u00e7as era inferior, de 3% a 6% dos embarcados.\n\nOs fatores que contribu\u00edram para a brusca diminui\u00e7\u00e3o no n\u00famero relativo de negros foram diversos. Primeiro, houve a grande imigra\u00e7\u00e3o europeia para o Brasil na segunda metade do  e na primeira metade do XX. Segundo, a mortalidade era bem maior entre os pretos, que, em geral, n\u00e3o tinham acesso \u00e0 boa alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o, saneamento b\u00e1sico e servi\u00e7os m\u00e9dicos.\n\nReferindo-se \u00e0 diminui\u00e7\u00e3o de negros na popula\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira, Jo\u00e3o Batista de Lacerda, \u00fanico latino-americano a apresentar um relat\u00f3rio no I Congresso Universal de Ra\u00e7as, em Londres, no ano de 1911, escreveu que: \"no Brasil j\u00e1 se viram filhos de m\u00e9tis (mesti\u00e7os, pardos) apresentarem, na terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o, todos os caracteres f\u00edsicos da ra\u00e7a branca[...]. Alguns ret\u00eam uns poucos tra\u00e7os da sua ascend\u00eancia negra por influ\u00eancia do atavismo(\u2026) mas a influ\u00eancia da sele\u00e7\u00e3o sexual (\u2026) tende a neutralizar a do atavismo, e remover dos descendentes dos m\u00e9tis todos os tra\u00e7os da ra\u00e7a negra(\u2026) Em virtude desse processo de redu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9tnica, \u00e9 l\u00f3gico esperar que no curso de mais um s\u00e9culo os m\u00e9tis tenham desaparecido do Brasil. Isso coincidir\u00e1 com a extin\u00e7\u00e3o paralela da ra\u00e7a negra em nosso meio\".\n\nA pol\u00edtica de imigra\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira no  n\u00e3o era somente um meio do governo de ocupar terras n\u00e3o ocupadas, conseguir mais m\u00e3o de obra e desenvolver-se, mas tamb\u00e9m de \"civilizar\" e \"embranquecer\" o pa\u00eds com popula\u00e7\u00e3o europeia. O decreto n\u00famero 528 de 1890, assinado pelo presidente Deodoro da Fonseca e pelo ministro da Agricultura Francisco Glic\u00e9rio determinava que a entrada de imigrantes da \u00c1frica e da \u00c1sia seria permitida apenas com autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do Congresso Nacional. O mesmo decreto n\u00e3o restringia, at\u00e9 incentivava, a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o de europeus. At\u00e9 ser revogado em 1907, este decreto praticamente proibiu a imigra\u00e7\u00e3o de africanos e asi\u00e1ticos para o Brasil. Apesar de necessitar muito de m\u00e3o de obra pouco qualificada em v\u00e1rios momentos hist\u00f3ricos, depois do fim do tr\u00e1fico de escravos para o Brasil nunca se pensou em trazer imigrantes livres da \u00c1frica.\n\nA fam\u00edlia escrava \nDurante muitos anos, diversos historiadores e antrop\u00f3logos sustentaram que, no Brasil, os escravos n\u00e3o formavam fam\u00edlias. Florestan Fernandes afirmava que os escravos eram an\u00f4micos, n\u00e3o tinham solidariedade entre si e a fam\u00edlia, n\u00e3o apenas a linhagem, como a nuclear, com o pai presente, nunca existiu. Para esses autores, a uni\u00e3o entre negros era passageira, gerando filhos ileg\u00edtimos, sendo que os la\u00e7os de parentesco e a vida familiar eram destru\u00eddos pela venda, pelos obst\u00e1culos impostos pelos senhores quanto \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fam\u00edlias entre os escravos e pelo com\u00e9rcio interno que desmantelava essas uni\u00f5es. As poucas fam\u00edlias que existiam eram centradas na m\u00e3e e, quase sempre, os filhos eram criados sem a presen\u00e7a do pai.\n\nEstudos mais recentes, contudo, refutam essas ideias. Apesar de incipientes, as novas pesquisas mostram que eram altas as taxas de casamentos entre escravos, feitos na igreja, nas regi\u00f5es de plantation do Sudeste do Brasil. Indicam tamb\u00e9m uma estabilidade impressionante nessas fam\u00edlias, havendo conviv\u00eancia pr\u00f3xima entre pais e filhos. Nas propriedades grandes e antigas, em particular, essa estabilidade era evidente nas diversas fam\u00edlias extensas encontradas, nas quais existiam membros de tr\u00eas gera\u00e7\u00f5es convivendo com seus irm\u00e3os adultos e respectivos filhos. Este foi, pelo menos, o quadro encontrado no Oeste Paulista e no Vale do Para\u00edba oitocentista.\n\nHavia, contudo, diferen\u00e7as regionais. Na Bahia tanto para o  quanto para o XIX, as taxas de ilegitimidade eram alt\u00edssimas, denotando a falta de casamentos formais entre escravos, sendo que algumas par\u00f3quias sequer registraram um \u00fanico filho leg\u00edtimo. Em contrapartida, na freguesia de Campos dos Goitacases, no Rio de Janeiro setecentista, a taxa de legitimidade entre as crian\u00e7as nascidas de escravos era elevad\u00edssima, sendo metade do total, chegando a 86% em algumas freguesias. Ainda n\u00e3o se sabe explicar a raz\u00e3o dessas diferen\u00e7as regionais, embora possam denotar que os n\u00edveis de assimila\u00e7\u00e3o cultural variavam entre as etnias africanas. Enquanto no Sudeste do Brasil a maioria dos escravos era banto, considerado mais facilmente assimil\u00e1vel na tradi\u00e7\u00e3o cat\u00f3lica (embora isso possa ser questionado), no Nordeste e, em particular, na Bahia, a maioria dos escravos era nag\u00f4, sendo que Salvador foi palco de diversas revoltas escravas que n\u00e3o foram observadas no resto do Brasil. Isso indicaria que o nag\u00f4 estava menos disposto a aceitar as regras familiares impostas pelo catolicismo.\n\nDe qualquer maneira, n\u00e3o se pode dizer que os escravos eram an\u00f4micos. Mesmo nas regi\u00f5es onde n\u00e3o imperava a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fam\u00edlias segundo as normas cat\u00f3licas, havia outras maneiras pelas quais os escravos podiam criar seus la\u00e7os familiares, como na substitui\u00e7\u00e3o dos pais biol\u00f3gicos por outros parentes e tamb\u00e9m na inclus\u00e3o de n\u00e3o parentes para preencher os vazios na fam\u00edlia extensa. De maneira geral, os casamentos formais eram pouco frequentes no Brasil colonial, mesmo entre os livres, quer brancos, quer de ascend\u00eancia africana. Em 1805, na comarca de Sabar\u00e1, em Minas Gerais, apenas 29,7% dos brancos, 24,5% dos mulatos e 21,4% dos negros haviam se casado na igreja.\n\nPara Florestan Fernandes, os senhores destru\u00edam as fam\u00edlias escravas para viabilizar a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do escravismo, vez que criariam escravos an\u00f4micos, sem uni\u00e3o e sem poder de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o. Florentino e G\u00f3es t\u00eam uma vis\u00e3o oposta, sustentando que os senhores incentivavam a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de fam\u00edlias entre os escravos pois a cria\u00e7\u00e3o desses la\u00e7os afetivos coibiam as revoltas internas, garantindo a paz nas senzalas.\n\nHebe Maria Mattos sustenta que, no Brasil, a forma\u00e7\u00e3o dessas fam\u00edlias n\u00e3o construiu uma identidade negra e escrava, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o a uma identidade branca e livre, como ocorreu nos Estados Unidos. A fam\u00edlia, embora n\u00facleo fundamental na vida dos cativos, n\u00e3o criou uma identidade racial, mas uma que aproximava os escravos dos homens livres pobres.\n\nMiscigena\u00e7\u00e3o \nO processo de miscigena\u00e7\u00e3o entre africanos, europeus e ind\u00edgenas foi fundamental na constitui\u00e7\u00e3o da popula\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira. O fen\u00f4meno, contudo, n\u00e3o levou a uma democracia racial, como quiserem alguns autores, vez que ra\u00e7a, cor da pele, origem e classe social sempre exerceram influ\u00eancia direta nas oportunidades de mobilidade social dos habitantes do Brasil.

Veal\nBiloxi, Mississippi\nDavid D. Burrage\nMarine Resources Specialist\nMississippi State University Extension Service\nSea Grant Advisory Service\nCoastal Research and Extension Center\nPublished by the Office of Agricultural Communications, Division of Agriculture, Forestry, and Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University, Keith H. Remy, Senior Publications Editor.\nIn 1995 NOAA's Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management, Coastal Programs Division, announced the intention to address a comprehensive technical assistance initiative for Coastal Zone Management Programs, with the goal of transferring data from local or regional coastal experiences to the national arena. Priority focus areas were identified and ranked. First in priority was Cumulative and Secondary Impacts of Development, with a proposed strategy to assist states in developing procedures to assess, consider, and control the impacts of growth and development.\nFollowing a briefing on the initiative and concurrent announcement of the availability of Section 308 funds targeted for the goal of \"Furthering the National Dimension,\" Mississippi Coastal Zone Management (CZM) staff members began assessing the state's ability to support and advance the goals of the initiative through Section 308 funding. Ultimately, this assessment focused upon a first-year action project identified for the initiative -- the establishment of a federal and state advisory group to discuss cumulative and secondary impact issues common to many coastal states and territories. Mississippi CZM staff reasoned that the burgeoning dockside gaming industry, which has the potential to affect all of the coastal zone states, fit this task quite well, and Mississippi's casino development experience could provide valuable, transferrable guidance. Over the past 4 years, Mississippi has become uniquely qualified in dealing with dockside gaming impacts. Since March 1992, when voters approved legalized dockside gaming, an explosion of new development has occurred along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Regional and national attention has focused on Mississippi as it has rapidly grown to one of the top three gaming areas of the country and the premier area for dockside gaming.\nThrough a special grant proposal, the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources Coastal Zone Management Program requested and received funds to sponsor and host a dockside gaming conference/workshop in support of the OCRM/CPD Technical Assistance Initiative. The Environmental Protection Agency's Gulf of Mexico Program was invited to cosponsor the workshop, and Mississippi State University's Coastal Research and Extension Center served as facilitator. The workshop featured national, regional, and local expert panelists who presented a broad range of issues dealing with cumulative and secondary impacts that can arise from the siting of dockside gaming in a coastal community.\nThis publication of the workshop proceedings expands the workshop results to a wide audience and fulfills the goal of realizing a national perspective on cumulative and secondary impacts from growth and development.\nMany collaborators contributed to the success of this conference. Financial assistance and logistical support were provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management and the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Consortium; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency through the auspices of the Gulf of Mexico Program; the U.S. Department of Agriculture through the Mississippi State University Extension Service; and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources.\nGratitude is also expressed to the following agencies and individuals who participated in the conference: Mississippi State Senator Tommy Gollott; Mississippi Gaming Commission; Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV; Mississippi Office of Secretary of State; Mississippi Casino Operators Association; University of New Orleans; City of Biloxi, Mississippi; Gulf Central Seafood, Inc.; Gulf Coast Association of Realtors; Mississippi Coast Crime Commission; Mississippi Council on Compulsive Gambling; Gulf Islands Conservancy; Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund; Harrison County, Mississippi Wastewater Management District; Brown and Mitchell, Inc.; Mississippi State Senator William G. Hewes, III; and the University of Maine School of Law. The knowledge and expertise provided by these participants were invaluable.\nThe mention of trade names or commercial products herein does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation. Any errors of omission or commission are those of the editors.\nMississippi Dockside Gaming Legislation\nMississippi State Senator Tommy Gollott\nDistrict 5 -- Harrison and Jackson Counties\nThe gaming industry is relatively new to Mississippi. The first laws favorable to gaming were enacted in 1989. That legislation allowed cruise vessels on the Mississippi Sound to have gaming paraphernalia on board. Those vessels were required to cruise 1,500 feet from the boundary of the Mississippi Sound. At that time, the vessels were in international waters and gaming could begin. The boats circled in the international waters while gaming occurred and then returned. Because the vessels were licensed by the state of Mississippi, a problem occurred. There was no way to determine how much money the casinos were making in Mississippi and how much they were making in international waters. Therefore, in 1990, legislation made provisions for cruise vessels in the Mississippi Sound and riverboats on the Mississippi River. Regulations provided for cruise vessels underway-making way (meaning that boats could cruise in the Mississippi Sound and return to their ports with gaming on board during that time). Senators Gollott and Dearing introduced the legislation.\nRepresentative Sonny Meredith, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, expressed concern over the underway-making way aspect of the bill. He believed that dockside gaming would be more advantageous to the state. He feared that vessels entering the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River might be confiscated with all the gaming paraphernalia by the State of Arkansas. The Mississippi House of Representatives was convinced that underway-making way should be removed from the legislation. Both bills returned to the Senate. The first bill on the docket was the bill for the Mississippi cruise vessels on the Gulf Coast. A battle ensued. Jackson County wanted to ensure that construction of the vessels could take place in their county. However, the county wanted to be certain they would not be affected by pollution as a result of sandblasting the vessels. The bill with that provision went into conference. The bill for the Coast, providing for underway-making way, also went into conference. The second bill from the House (the Senate bill) had the underway-making way provision removed. This bill passed. Now the stage was set for dockside gaming on the Mississippi River. Both bills passed.\nIn June of 1990 Governor Ray Mabus called the Legislature into special session. In the special session, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Gaming Regulations Act. When the Senate was formulating the gaming regulations, Senator Hannon Miller was appointed subcommittee chairman of the Gaming Act (the Senator was opposed to gaming). The Assistant Attorney-General of Nevada was invited to Mississippi. He worked with the Mississippi Senate throughout the special session familiarizing the Senate with Nevada's gaming regulations. The Mississippi Senate took advantage of Nevada's expertise in formulating legislation. Special care was taken to include provisions to discourage undesirable people from participating in Mississippi's gaming industry. Senator Miller's expertise and Nevada's experience equipped the Mississippi Senate to propose and to pass effective gaming legislation. The next step was formulating the Gaming Commission through the Gaming Act. Mississippi determined that three people, to be appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate, should constitute the Gaming Commission.\nA bonus of the gaming industry was the state's collection of $33.6 million in fiscal year 1993. In 1994, the revenue was $94.9 million. In 1995, the revenue climbed to $128 million. The projection for fiscal year 1996 is $132 million. Of that $132 million, $33 million will fund road construction and infrastructure in the counties that have gaming. The Highway Department can issue $323 million in bonds. The $33 million annual revenue will apply to the retirement of those bonds if and when they are issued. The bonds, however, have not been issued for the gaming counties. The present revenues are funding the roads, setups, and any other expenses of roadways in those counties. It is possible that bonds will not have to be issued for the gaming counties because of the incoming revenues. The projected income for 1997 is $140 million, an increase from $132 million in 1996. Of the increase, 25% will fund road construction in the counties that have gaming. In cities and municipalities where gaming exists, taxes on the casino earnings also contribute to the revenues. For example, in the City of Biloxi, legislation provides for an additional 3.2% in local and private taxes. Of this, 20% is directed to education. Another 20% is allocated for law enforcement. Revenues for the city of Gulfport are the same.\nThe county receives from each vessel 20% of the 3.2%, with 10% allocated to education and 10% allocated to public safety. Then, 40% of the 3.2% is directed to the City of Biloxi for funding the infrastructure. All areas in Mississippi with gaming have similar allocations. In addition, tidelands funds have provided an allocation of more than $10 million. Tidelands funds provide for the infrastructure pertaining to the seafood industry and to sports fishing and marine-related activities. In the last 2 years, more than $800,000 have been appropriated to build fishing banks throughout the three coastal counties as well as in waters outside the State of Mississippi.\nCasinos have contributed to enlarging the coffers in many ways. The Convention Center in Harrison County has been expanded as a result of revenues from hotels and motels. The year before the inception of gaming, the 3% hotel and motel tax yielded a total of $700,000. The current yield of that revenue is $2.7 million. More hotels and motels are a direct result of the gaming industry. Recent legislation allowed the Coast Coliseum and Convention Center to issue $10 million in bonds. One-third of the 3% that the Coliseum and Convention Center presently receives will fund a 70,000-square-foot addition to the Center.\nCoastal ports have also benefitted from the effects of gaming. Legislation this year was designed to increase the bonded indebtedness of the Biloxi Port Commission from $3 million to $10 million. The commission plans to build a marina behind or in front of the Imperial Palace Casino. The 240-slip marina will be funded by the lease from the Imperial Palace, with the lease paying for the bonded indebtedness. The Port of Gulfport plans to double in size, using monies coming from both gaming and the port itself.\nNaturally, tourism is flourishing and is expected to grow. An international airport is projected to be located on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 15 years, bringing tourists from around the world. Those tourists can enjoy playing at the already established 30-plus golf courses within a radius of 50 miles. With the mild coastal climate, golfing is a year-round pleasure. High-profile fishing also adds to the tourism scene. Completing the charm of Coastal Mississippi is its rich history.\nThe effect of casinos on unemployment rates has been dramatic. Approximately 15,000 people work directly in the gaming industry. Another 15,000 people are employed in other casino-related businesses. Tunica County has seen a tremendous impact. Before gaming, that county's unemployment rate was between 23 and 25%. Currently, the rate is less than 5%. In coastal Mississippi, the Harrison County unemployment rate dropped from 8.7% to 5.2%. All in all, gaming has exerted a positive effect on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. With the expansion and building of infrastructure, gaming interests can continue to locate here. The saturation point with regard to casinos probably will not occur for another 10 years. Of the states involved in the gaming industry, it seems certain that Nevada and Mississippi will be the two leaders.\nSection I: The Regulatory and Permitting Process\nThe Gaming Commission Permit Review Process and Industry Enforcement\nGary McGee\nChief of Investigations\nMississippi Gaming Commission\nWith the casino industry in Mississippi, a Gaming Commission was important. Before October 1, 1993, the Mississippi Tax commission exercised temporary powers and duties of the Gaming Commission. The Gaming Control Act had been passed by a special session of the Legislature in 1990. In April of 1991, the Legislature appropriated $300,000 for the overall operation of the Gaming Commission, with 16 positions being authorized. Eleven casinos opened and were licensed; eight manufacturers and distributors of gaming products were licensed. After October 1, 1993, the Gaming Commission was created as a separate entity. The Governor, with the consent of the Senate, appointed three nonsalaried commissioners. According to law, these commissioners are to meet on or after the fifteenth of each month. The Mississippi Gaming Commission meets the first Thursday after the fifteenth of the month and on special occasions when a need arises.\nThe Executive Director of the Gaming Commission in Mississippi is General Paul Harvey. General Harvey has been an asset to gaming in Mississippi. The Commission operates on an annual budget of $11 million. Approximately 136 of the 164 approved employee positions are filled. The Mississippi Gaming Commission licensed and opened 23 casinos between October 1, 1993 and August 1, 1994, a 100% increase over the number licensed prior to October 1, 1993. In Mississippi, 29 casinos are now licensed and open, and they employ 27,140 people. Casinos are subject to relicensure every 2 years.\nThe Governor is at the apex of the organizational structure of the Gaming Commission. The three commissioners are under the direction of the Governor, followed by the executive director and division directors. The executive director of the Commission was authorized to create additional divisions to implement the provisions of the Gaming Control Act. Consequently, General Harvey created the following divisions: Compliance, MIS, Police, Intelligence, Personnel, Administrative Training, Gaming Laboratory, Industry Relations, Research, and Public Relations.\nThe Enforcement Division and the Investigative Division were established earlier by the Legislature. The Enforcement Division sends its agents out on a day-to-day basis ascertaining that all laws and regulations are being followed in the casinos. Members of the Investigative Division investigate those people who have potential control over and within the casinos. Examples of the subjects of investigation are owners, officers, surveillance directors, and stockholders. Within the casinos, key employees are pit bosses, shift managers, directors, security directors, or slot technicians.\nThe purpose of the Gaming Commission is to implement the Mississippi Gaming Control Act. The Commission provides a process for licensing and regulating legalized dockside gaming on the Mississippi River and any of its navigable tributaries, and on the Gulf Coast south of the three southernmost counties. A gaming license is deemed a revokable privilege. The holder of the license has no vested rights in that license. The license is issued to the holder (corporation or partnership). The law authorizes the executive director of the Gaming Commission to investigate applicants and licensees. The executive director then makes a recommendation to the Commission on the suitability or denial of the applicant. The recommendations may have conditions or limitations. After the director's recommendation, the commissioners have the full and absolute power and authority to approve or deny any application. The commissioners can limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any license or finding of suitability that it has issued. In addition, commissioners can fine any licensed person for violations committed by the casino or its personnel. Along with monitoring the casinos, the Commission also monitors the manufacturers and distributors of gaming products, making certain that they are in compliance with the Gaming Control Act and its regulations.\nThe legal geographic location for dockside gaming has been discussed often. That location is defined as \"in the waters within the state of Mississippi, which lie adjacent to the State of Mississippi south of the three most southern counties in the State of Mississippi.\" Recently, the Mississippi Supreme Court rendered two decisions, one related to a casino on a bayou and the other on a manmade canal. The Court stated that any river, such as the Wolf, Tchoutacabouffa, Pascagoula; any manmade canal; or other bays are illegal for casino sites. The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled, however, that the Bay of St. Louis and the Biloxi Back Bay are legal sites.\nThe second legal location for dockside gaming is on the Mississippi River or any of its navigable tributaries. Thus, dockside gaming is legal in the following nine counties in Mississippi: Adams, Claiborne, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Issaquena, Tunica, Washington, and Warren.\nA specific procedure must be followed in applying for a gaming license in Mississippi.\nFirst, the applicant must provide the Mississippi Gaming Commission with a written notice of intent. The information in the notice identifies the exact site, the exact location of the boat at the site, and related infrastructure plans. Maps and pictures must also be included. Approval or disapproval is given to publishing the notice of intent in a local newspaper for 3 consecutive weeks. If approval is given to publication, then gaming application and fingerprint cards are provided.\nAfter the third week of publishing the notice of intent, the applicant submits a written request for a site assessment, and this request is submitted to the executive director. The applicant files the application, a $5,000 application fee, and two sets of fingerprint cards. Upon receipt of the application, the executive director will notify the board of supervisors of the county of the proposed casino site along with the mayor of that municipality, if applicable.\nThe Gaming Commission then conducts a hearing to determine whether to approve the proposed site and site development plan for the casino. The hearing will consist of presentations by the applicant, which include the specific location of the property, the current use of any adjacent property, and the location of the nearest residential area, church, or school. The complete site development plan should include all structures planned and the expected completion date. Evidence is submitted that various agencies (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard, Mississippi Department of Transportation, Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality, Department of Marine Resources, Board of Supervisors, Port and Harbor Commission, Levee Board, Mayor's office, City and County Planning Commission, and Preservation Commission) do not oppose the site development plan. Following the presentation, the public is provided time to comment on the proposal. After the hearing on the proposed site, the executive director will offer a recommendation to the Commission, which will then approve or disapprove the recommendation. The Commission may request additional information.\nThe applicant is then subjected to in-depth background and financial investigation. Corporate investigations are also undertaken. Construction usually begins shortly after site approval.\nFollowing this process, a development plan consisting of vessel specifications and design, shore development plans, infrastructure plans, and an operation/implementation timetable is submitted. Detailed descriptions of the games to be played are required. The executive director then makes a recommendation for issuance or denial of a license. If the license is approved by the Commission, the director monitors the implementation of the approved operation implementation timetable and the licensee provides a monthly status report to the Commission detailing the progress. Before final approval can be given, the Gaming Commission makes a final inspection of the vessel and reviews compliance with all federal, state, and local laws and regulations and ordinances before giving final approval.\nGaming is an asset to Mississippi. Jobs created directly by the casinos number 27,140. Throughout the state, 50,000 additional jobs have been created as a result of the gaming industry. Gross revenues generated from gaming were $122 million in 1992, $790 million in 1993, and $1.5 billion in 1994. In 1995, revenues climbed to $1.7 billion. In January and February of this year (1996), gross revenues were $287 million. The gaming revenues from casinos on the Mississippi River continuously exceed revenues on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The economic future of Mississippi is bright.\nWetlands Permitting -- Coastal Program Consistency Review\nDave Ruple\nChief of Wetlands\nMississippi Department of Marine Resources\nThe Mississippi Coastal Program is a joint state and federal tool that has been approved by the State of Mississippi and the U.S. Department of Commerce. This tool provides a mechanism by which the state manages its coastal resources in the coastal zone of Mississippi. The coastal zone of Mississippi is defined by the three coastal counties: Jackson, Harrison, and Hancock. Glade Woods is the Executive Director of the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources, which administers the Mississippi Coastal Program.\nThe program incorporates all the provisions of the Coastal Wetlands Protection Law that were passed in 1973. In addition, the Coastal Program agencies include the Department of Marine Resources, the Department of Environmental Quality, and the Department of Archives and History. The wetland permitting activities that accompany most dockside gaming facilities on the Coast are covered by regulative activities that are described in the Coastal Wetlands Protection Law of 1973 and the Mississippi Coastal Program. The Coastal Program was adopted by the state in 1980 as its coastal management policy.\nThe public policy of wetlands protection (defined in the Coastal Wetlands Protection Law) serves as a foundation and basis by which the Department manages the resources. The guidelines and plans of the policy are described in the Mississippi Coastal Program. The Department seeks to balance the preservation of coastal resources in their natural states with the alteration of those resources for the public benefit. In seeking a balance of development and environmental protection, important goals of the Coastal Program are protection of the environment, the enhancement of certain resources for the public benefit, and economic development of water-dependent industries along the Coast. When the program was initially developed, many sites along the Coast were primarily reserved for those commercial and industrial activities that require waterfront locations for siting.\nThe advent of gaming has affected this program, and attempts have been made over the past 4 years to accommodate a degree of gaming development while keeping in mind the other developmental needs of waterfront sites on the Coast. The passing of the gaming legislation created a new water-dependent industry on the Coast, so the Department adapted the program to accommodate this industry. Now the Department has permitted 18 casino sites on the Coast. The permitting of those casino sites in some marina-designated areas and industrial areas has created an added pressure for additional marina space. In some cases, industrial spaces are now taken up by dockside gaming activities. It is important to balance these pressures and seek ways to revise the Program to accommodate future industry.\nWetlands permitting begins with the submission of a permit application to the Department. These permit applications cover a variety of regulated activities that are spelled out in the Coastal Wetlands Protection Law and in the Mississippi Coastal Program. Within the program and the law, certain activities and entities are exempted from needing to secure permits, although activities must comply with provisions of the Mississippi Coastal Program. One of the most important aspects of the program sometimes drawing fire is the Coastal Wetlands Use Plan. This is a zoning of the public waters of the state along the Coast, establishing use districts allowing for certain activities in certain zones. In addition, a set of guidelines for regulated activities outlines specific ways that certain regulated activities are to be conducted along the Coast. Furthermore, provisions for federal consistency (any federal action or activity in the coastal zone, whether a license or permit or plan) call for compliance with enforceable policies of the Mississippi Coastal Program. The final permit decisions are determined by the Commission on Marine Resources when that body considers recommendations on a project that is evaluated by the staff of the Department of Marine Resources. Subsequently, the Department staff carries out the recommendations and the wishes of the Commission based on its findings; this would be either a recommendation of denying a permit request or an approval for one.\nThe Wetlands Use Plan is a tool that has been utilized not only for casino development along the Coast but also for overall development. It serves to set aside specific areas for certain types of development. The predominant uses within the use plan are \"C\" zones, which are for commercial, recreational, marinas; \"I\" zones, which are for industrial, commercial, and manufacturing water-dependent activities; \"S\" zones, which are for areas that are leased by the Secretary of State's office; and \"P\" districts, which are preservation areas. Over the past 4 years, the Department has attempted to utilize the provisions of the Use Plan and the entire Coastal Program in managing the state's resources and in trying to accommodate an orderly development along the Coast.\nOne very important aspect of the Mississippi Coastal Program and coastal programs in general across the nation are the provisions for federal consistency. The provisions cause a joint effort whereby all federal actions in a coastal zone have to comply with all of the provisions of the approved state and federal coastal management program.\nThe Department of Marine Resources staff that deals with casino and other permitting activities has decreased from five to three members. Since the Commission deals with all of the other development and related regulated activities that occur along the Coast, the decrease in members has caused pressure. In 1992, approximately 400 actions relating to wetland permits, violations, or wetland determinations were taken by the staff. Last year, that number approached approximately 650. Obviously, the workload has increased dramatically with the increased development along the Coast. When evaluating wetland permits, it is important to look at secondary and cumulative impacts of the dockside casino industry on the Coast. Some areas of particular concern are the dredging that is proposed and the relative rate at which some of the dredge spoil areas are being utilized. One of the concerns of casinos is the best way to accommodate maintenance dredging activities after the casino barges are in place. There is no evaluation of wastewater treatment. In addition, the displacement of some of the traditional uses in the coastal zone by the casino industry is an important consideration. The issues of storm water runoff, drainage, and drainage patterns within all the cities along the Coast are matters of concern. The increased development along the Coast, with subdivisions and the filling of some nontidal wetlands, affects drainage patterns.\nAccommodating this new waterfront industry presents a challenge. However, the tools are in place to achieve a balance between environmental and public purpose wetlands protection that is defined in the Coastal Wetlands Protection Law.\nThe Water Quality Review Process in Mississippi\nRobert Seyfarth\nMississippi Department of Environmental Quality\nOffice of Pollution Control\nThe Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality is the state agency that regulates the environmental requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. Three agencies are within the Department of Environmental Quality. The Office of Geology regulates mining. The Office of Land and Water Resources issues permits for water usage, (surface and ground water usage), and the dam safety program. The third agency is Office of Pollution Control, which is comprised of a number of divisions. These divisions address matters like air pollution, solid and hazardous waste, ground water, surface water (which includes issuance of permits), and issuance of discharge permits for municipalities and industries.\nThe Water Quality Management Branch handles the development of the state's water quality criteria for surface waters and water classifications and is responsible for the state's nonpoint source pollution program. This agency has worked closely with the Department of Marine Resources on the Coastal Nonpoint Source Program that evolved through the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Federal Clean Water Act requires states to conduct a water quality certification program. The Act also requires states to certify that federally-permitted activities, which may result in a discharge into waters of the state, will comply with applicable discharge limitations, water quality standards, and other requirements.\nOver the years the agency has gradually developed a process of reviewing projects. The type of federal permit that is most frequently dealt with is the dredge-and-fill permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Regulations in the Department clearly define the review process. A number of things are considered in the review.\nFirst, the agency looks for feasible alternatives to what is being proposed. Although all projects are reviewed in a like manner, the agency does determine if an alternate location is feasible. Perhaps things can be done to minimize the impacts of the project, with particular regard to the footprint that may impact wetlands or waters. After that determination is complete, other effects are analyzed to attempt to determine what can be done to mitigate those impacts. Likewise, the agency evaluates the direct impacts of the project (the effects of the construction of a project) and attempts to determine the secondary impacts of the project in terms of the water quality standards or classified uses.\nNext, compliance with the water quality standards and classifications is analyzed. Also, the agency determines the degree of physical, chemical, and biological impacts of the project. Are there going to be any impacts to circulation patterns or water movement that may create some water quality problems, such as stagnant situations? In particular for casinos, the agency conducts an evaluation of the basin in which the vessel may be sitting looking for any water quality problems related to the design. Will an alteration to the natural ecosystem occur that will cause problems? Is the project consistent with any adopted water quality management plans that are in place? For example, across the state, numerous wastewater plans have been developed that contemplate regional wastewater systems. Consistency with those plans is important. Another area of concern and importance is storm water management. Because casino projects propose large paved areas for parking and other impervious type surfaces like roofs, storm water becomes a significant issue. In addition, the regulations allow the Department to evaluate other factors necessary to protect water quality.\nMany factors influence permit denial. Regulations specify factors that may trigger denial of water quality certification. Denial of water quality certification is significant because the federal agency (in this case the Corps of Engineers) cannot issue a federal permit. As a result, the project cannot be built. One instance that might trigger denial would be a project's altering of the ecosystem. Another example is waters not supporting designated uses, or a feasible alternative existing that the applicant could use that would reduce impacts to water quality. Furthermore, denial could occur if a project were to have adverse impacts to rare, threatened, or endangered species or to any habitat or outstanding resource waters. Likewise, if the project caused adverse cumulative impacts, or if the project did not adequately address the nonpoint source runoff during construction or storm water management, a permit would be in jeopardy. The project not receiving required wastewater permits would certainly trigger denial. Finally, denial would occur if the project would cause significant environmental impacts.\nFor casino projects, several things have been particularly important in the review for water quality. First is the avoidance of wetlands. At this point, only about 0.3-acre of wetlands has been filled along the Gulf Coast. The small figure is a result of the diligence of the state and federal regulation agencies in avoiding development in wetlands. However, most of the easy sites have been developed. The avoidance of wetlands will become a more critical issue as more projects are initiated.\nAnother area of concern is wastewater treatment. Because very large developments with land-based features (such as hotels) are being built and planned, the agency must ascertain that the capacity to treat the wastewater exists. It also must ensure that the development does not affect water quality standards. Finally, the impacts of dredging and disposal of dredge material are concerns applicable particularly to casino projects.\nCasino development has affected the workload of the agency employees. Two full-time workers review these projects, and until the advent of gaming, two employees could review all Section 404 projects statewide. These very large casino projects are on fast schedules. When very large industries locate in Mississippi and undergo a permitting and a review process, it generally takes months and months for the facility to be built. Eventually the industry operates. However, the casino industry is on a different timetable. The construction takes place 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Construction is completed quickly. The speed of construction has created difficulties for the agency in checking and verifying the conditions of certifications.\nBecause of the increase in workload, the Legislature has been very kind to the agency this session. The legislators approved an increase in the number of positions in the agency, particularly in the area of monitoring Mississippi waters. Efforts to accelerate the monitoring process should lead to better water quality in the coastal community.\nThe COE Review Process\nRonald A. Krizman\nRegulatory Branch\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District\nThe U.S. Army is indirectly involved in gaming permitting in the State of Mississippi. In the early days of the country, the Corps was the federal agency that surveyed and mapped navigable waters of the United States. Later, the Corps began maintaining navigable waters and even built them. In the late 1800's, Congress passed a law that required that anyone doing work in navigable waters in the United States must first have a Department of the Army permit issued by the Corps of Engineers. As a result, the Army became involved in its first regulatory mission. Then, when the National Environmental Policy Act of 1968 and the Clean Water Act of 1970 came into being, the Corps' mission in the regulatory arena was increased.\nToday, the Corps' activities are really fourfold. One activity is the evaluation of the Department of the Army permit applications. Another is the making of decisions on those particular permits. The third is the investigation and resolution of any violations of several laws, sections of which the Corps administers. The fourth activity is making wetlands and navigability determinations.\nThe Mobile District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is one of 30-plus districts spread throughout the United States and overseas. In every way, the Mobile District is one of the largest of the Corps' districts. The regulatory boundary within the Mobile District encompasses the State of Alabama south of the Tennessee River watershed, as well as the eastern one-third of the State of Mississippi, including 98% of its coastal area. Any casino industry that comes into the coastal area of Mississippi has to apply to the Corps of Engineers for a permit. The casinos that are operating or locating on the Mississippi River in navigable waters will be working with either the Memphis or the Vicksburg Districts. Section 10 of the River and Harbor Control Act of 1899 is one of the basic laws that the Corps administers. Any work in, over, or under a navigable water dictates a Corps permit. Some types of work that normally occur in the navigable waters and require a permit are dredging, bulkheading, and building piers.\nThe Corps becomes involved in areas outside of navigable waters because of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. The Corps is responsible for the permitting through Section 404 of that same act, which states that any dredging or filling of waters in the United States requires a Department of the Army permit issued by the Corps. The term \"waters in the United States\" is a more encompassing term than \"navigable waters.\" Navigable waters are those associated with interstate commerce. The Mississippi Sound and the Mississippi River are considered navigable waters. The waters of the United States include not only those navigable waters but also the tributaries, sloughs, and even wetlands that may be found behind one's home. These wetlands fall within the jurisdiction of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Therefore, casino builders who locate in coastal Mississippi need not only a Section 10 permit for locating a casino that floats on navigable waters but also a Section 404 permit for some of the amenities (parking lots, hotels, golf courses, etc.) that may impact other \"waters of the United States,\" including wetlands. Presently, wetlands are probably one of the most controversial aspects of the whole Corps permitting program.\nA particular soil, the hydrology keeping the soil wet, and vegetation growing in the wet soil are the criteria for wetlands. These kinds of areas are considered jurisdictional wetlands of which a Corps permit would be required either to fill or excavate.\nThe first of the three criteria is vegetation. If the vegetation includes plants that would typically grow in a wet soil and these are the predominant vegetation, the criterion is met for that category. Cypress trees and lizard tail vegetation typically grow in wetlands. Another typical wetlands site contains pitcher plant bogs, mulberry bushes, and pines.\nAnother factor in determining wetland jurisdiction is whether the soil is a hydric one; that is, are the spaces between the soil particles typically filled with water as opposed to air. If the soil develops anaerobic conditions, then the second criterion to consider the area a jurisdictional wetland is fulfilled. The Natural Resource Conservation Service, formerly called the Soil Conservation Service, publishes soil maps that delineate the various types of soil found within an area. The soils are delineated in those maps as hydric or not. Therefore, looking at soil maps published by the Natural Conservation Service often determines whether a site is likely or not likely to be wetland.\nThe third and most difficult factor to determine is the hydrology. Hydrology keeps the soil wet and the wetland plants thriving. There are some definitions or some criteria used to determine whether the hydrology is met. However, hydrology determination is somewhat of an inexact science because it is viewed as a spot-in-time as opposed to an overall year-round look at any particular site. If the three criteria are met, the Corps designates the area to be a jurisdictional wetland, and any development must be accompanied by a Corps permit.\nThere are 36 various \"Nationwide Permits.\" The permits relate to any work performed within a wetland area that individually or cumulatively has a very insignificant impact. Those Nationwide Permits are issued by the Chief Engineer's Office, in Washington, DC and typically are valid throughout the United States. Many of them are aids to navigation and fish and wildlife activities. It is not always necessary to apply to the Corps for permission to use these permits. For example, the placement of a crab trap or crab pot in navigable waters is a structure within navigable waters being used for a purpose. Therefore, one of the Nationwide Permits covers that kind of activity to prevent the Corps from being inundated by permits for crab traps. When a road project involves a road crossing (and less than 200 linear feet of road would cut across a wetland) a Nationwide Permit would apply. Thirteen of these 36 permits--actually 14 of 37 now--require advance notification. The Corps must be informed of the intent to use these 14 particular Nationwide Permits. The Corps is allotted 30 calendar days to inform the applicant whether the project meets the criteria of the Nationwide Permit program. Those Nationwide Permits can be used for both Section 10 and Section 404.\nAnother type of permit is the \"Regional Permit.\" These are for projects that have more impact than projects covered by Nationwide Permits. For example, there is a Regional Permit covering up to 2,500 cubic yards of dredging, as long as the dredged material is placed at an upland site. In that case, a \"General Permit\" or \"Regional Permit\" can be used. In Mississippi a working agreement with the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources allows the issuance of these permits in the name of the Corps. A one-stop permitting process occurs by the applicant going to the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources. These permits are for minor impact projects, either in navigable waters or in wetlands. The timeframe for issuing these permits is 10 to 14 days.\nAnother type of permit is called the \"Letter of Permission Permit\" used when a navigable water only is involved. An example is a commercial pier or something similar that would impact only other navigational users. Issuing those types of permits is coordinated with the various state and federal agencies, as well as with the users of the navigable water in the area. Issuing a Letter of Permission takes from 2 weeks to a month.\nThe larger permit and the most controversial one is the \"Individual Permit.\" The Mobile District has a policy stating that any new casino siting will initially be evaluated as an Individual Permit. These large projects can cause big impacts. Individual Permits must be published with a 30-day public notice explaining the proposal. Federal and state agencies, as well as the general public interested in any of the resources, comment on the particular public notice recommending either denial, modifications, or expressing concerns.\nPublic hearings are possible depending upon which issues arise during the public comment period. If the District Engineer feels that a public hearing is needed to better answer concerns, a hearing is planned. An environmental assessment (EA) is developed to determine exactly what the environmental impacts of that particular project will be. If there are significant environmental impacts, an environmental impact statement (EIS) would be made before a permit decision occurred. Finalizing an EIS is a lengthy procedure. The formality of holding meetings and public hearings takes time. Finally, when a decision is made by the District Engineer, the EPA (which has the federal oversight for the Clean Water Act) has the authority to veto the Corps' decision. A veto seldom occurs. In fact, in the last 18 years since the Clean Water Act and the Corps became involved in that Act, only one instance in the Mobile District involved the EPA's vetoing a permit decision by the Mobile District Engineer.\nAnother law administered by the Corps is Section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, which is often termed the \"Ocean Dumping Act.\" If a dredging project does not have a place for disposing material except in federal waters, a Corps permit is needed for the transportation of the material from state or state waters into the federal ocean waters.\nSome changes in Corps permitting have occurred recently. The number of Nationwide Permits has increased in the last 2 years. Existing Nationwide Permits expire next January. The Chief of Engineers office in Washington will publish new Nationwide Permits before the existing ones expire. Furthermore, additional new Nationwide Permits will be published at the same time. Excavation of \"waters of the United States\" requires a permit today. Until 3 years ago, a wetland could be excavated digging 50 feet deep, and a Corps permit would not be needed if the material were not allowed to fall back into the existing wetlands. As a result of a Department of the Army settlement of a lawsuit, regulation of excavation was begun. Thus, a Section 404 permit is required not only to fill wetlands, but also to excavate wetlands. Regulation of pilings has changed in the last 2 or 3 years. In the past, pilings outside navigable waters were not regulated by the Corps. Now, however, pilings can be regulated. Because people went to extreme lengths trying to avoid needing a Corps permit, parking lots were being built on pilings. The Corps now regulates structures built on pilings that would normally have been placed on fill material.\nThe Clinton Administration has been responsible for a number of regulatory initiatives. While Mr. Bush was president, a \"no net loss\" goal for wetlands existed. While President Clinton has a no net loss goal, he has added an additional goal: \"higher quality wetlands.\" There is an Administration goal to expect a permit decision within 90 days unless certain conditions arise. Exceptions might be endangered species issues, resource problems, or the need for an EIS. Otherwise, the President's goal is a 90-day permit decision. Today, the number of days spent on a typical permit is probably about 118 to 120 overall. That figure should be reduced to 90 days. Currently the only appeal from a Corps District Engineer's decision is through a federal court. President Clinton will be establishing an appeal procedure for two things: a permit denial from the party who was denied the permit, and wetland jurisdiction determinations. Today when engineers perform a wetlands identification on someone's property and state that it is jurisdictional wetland, a permit is needed to impact those wetlands. Right now, the only way to avoid that decision is to appeal to federal court. However, under the new appeal procedure it will be appealed to the Corps District.\nFlexibility in permit decisions is helpful to the Corps. Not all wetlands are created equal. A low-quality wetland does not require spending much time determining whether there are alternatives to impacting those low-quality wetlands. Wetland criteria in the past have been the basis for controversy, especially in the early 1990's. Different federal agencies had various definitions of a wetland. The Corps is the federal agency that delineates wetlands. At times, the EPA and Fish and Wildlife Departments did not agree with the Corps because they had their own criteria for determining a wetland. Therefore, in 1993 the Clinton Administration declared that all federal agencies will use the same (Corps) wetland criteria. As a result, some of the controversy has dissipated.\nFinally, the Clinton Administration has proposed and encouraged the use of mitigation banking. After trying to avoid and minimize impacts to wetlands, the next step is compensating for those wetland impacts to meet the goal of no net loss. That compensation is called \"mitigation banking,\" and it is something that the Mississippi coastal counties are looking forward to, to prevent tiny mitigation sites that will probably have little chance of succeeding. However, a large area of wetland creation or wetland improvement used for mitigation would assist the permitting agencies and the recipient of the permit.\nThe goals of the Corps' regulatory program are to protect the waters in the United States and to provide for clearly definable development making fair, reasonable, and timely permit decisions.\nEPA's Role in Wetlands Permitting\nMike Wylie\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV\nRapid development in coastal Mississippi has caused impacts on the state's infrastructure, its citizens, and on the state's environment. The effects are both good and bad. The Mississippi Legislature legalized dockside gaming on the Mississippi River and along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Because both the EPA and the Corps have regulatory authority over waters of the United States, friction between the groups sometimes occurs. The 404 Permit Program is a conflict resolution process considering environmental issues, weighed alongside the public's interests. The Clean Water Act passed in 1972. The Act was a result of a continued degradation of our nation's waters. The degradation was a result of insults to the environment. One of the biggest examples of that degradation was the Cayahoga River, an Ohio river emptying into Lake Erie at Cleveland, which in the 1970's was depicted in newspapers in flames.\nObjectives of the Clean Water Act are the restoration and maintenance of the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the waters. That mission statement has caused great joy and much consternation since its inception in 1972. EPA was created before passage of the Act in 1970. The waters of the United States are defined as the navigable waters, interstate waters, intrastate waters, tributaries, territorial seas, and wetlands. There is an overlapping jurisdiction between state statute and gaming statute in the Federal Clean Water Act authority. In the early 1990's, the rationale was that the dockside casino was to be sited in certain areas that overlap Corps jurisdiction, but there would also be secondary development coupled with the footprint of that casino. That thinking caused great consternation throughout the federal family because evaluating the footprint of the casino is one thing, but secondary and cumulative impacts of upland development to ensure that casinos remain cause additional concern. Casinos should be evaluated on a broader scale.\nOne of EPA's roles in Section 404 is reviewing permits that the Corps has accepted. EPA, Fish and Wildlife Service, NMFS, and several other agencies review and make specific recommendations to the Corps of Engineers. Section 404 guidelines were written by EPA in 1975 and updated in 1981, creating specific guidelines that must be followed to be in conjunction with the Corps' compliance for a permit. These are some of the guidelines to which every casino, operator, or anyone applying for a Section 404 permit must adhere. However, under President Clinton's plan, additional flexibility is provided by issuing Nationwide Permits.\nThe first step in the permitting process is the evaluation of possible alternatives. In the beginning, friction exists between the casino industry and federal regulators because regulators investigate areas that can be quite sensitive in nature. The stage is set for a dispute when the job of regulators is to grant a permit, deny a permit, or recommend another site for the casino. After alternative sites are evaluated, regulators evaluate the effects of the discharge to other environmental standards. Bucking water standards and using a toxic discharge in fill material are in violation of the Clean Water Act. In addition, an assessment is made in relation to significant degradation to the waters of the United States. If a project might cause significant degradation to waters, the permit is going to be denied. Regulators look at assessment of appropriate steps to minimize impacts of the discharge.\nBecause of continuing development on the Coast, efforts to minimize and mitigate impacts have special significance. If EPA, NMFS, or Fish and Wildlife Service believe that a project does not comply with the guidelines and the Corps does not agree with that decision, another interesting conflict resolution process called the Section 404(a) elevation process is utilized. In 1993 a new memorandum of agreement between the agencies (Fish and Wildlife, the Corps, and EPA) was formulated. In the Section 404(a) elevation process, a dispute over a particular project results, documenting and evaluating problems with the environment. If a permit has unacceptable adverse impacts, EPA's 404 procedure is set into motion.\nIf a discharge, an excavation, or any kind of secondary cumulative impact associated with the project has impacts on the inshore water supplies, shellfish beds, fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife areas, or recreational areas, EPA will be compelled to go to our 404(a) authority. This authority may be used before and after the fact. This very time-consuming project usually has a short timeframe. Political pressures intervene. However, Congress has left this seldom-used procedure in place. EPA and the Corps jointly administer the enforcement program of Section 404.\nOn the Mississippi Gulf Coast, EPA has conducted two enforcement actions against casinos. One involved environmental remediation processes. The other one resulted in a penalty. EPA enforcement in Tunica County involved three enforcement matters (three penalties including environmental restoration). A significant penalty was issued by the Vicksburg Corps of Engineers against a casino. The casino industry on the Coast has tried to comply with Section 404. Direct impacts to wetlands have been minimal. However, secondary and cumulative impacts have been significant.\nThe Mississippi Public Trust Tidelands Lease Program\nMargaret Bretz\nPublic Lands Specialist\nOffice of the Mississippi Secretary of State\nIn the State of Mississippi, the Secretary of State is also the land commissioner; therefore, public lands, except agency lands, are under his administration. One of the two great land trusts that the state owns is the public trust tidelands and submerged lands. (The other is the Sixteenth Section School Land Trust.) Since these tidelands and submerged lands are publicly owned, compensation must be paid when some private exclusive use is made of these lands. The Secretary of State established an office here on the Coast in 1988 and thereafter adopted rules for the administration, control, and leasing of public trust tidelands. This tidelands lease program was in effect in March of 1992, when casino gambling was approved in Harrison County.\nBetween August 1992 and August 1994, 10 leases were executed for casinos. Regulations specify that the leases be granted only to the adjacent upland owner or his assignee, so the applicant for the lease must own or control the adjacent uplands. The policy has been to preclude any new commercial leases off publicly funded sand beaches in the coastal counties. The policy has had the effect of confining additional development to the previously disturbed or impacted areas, ports, and harbors along the Coast and the area of downtown Biloxi, including the Broadwater, the old Sea & Sirloin Steak House, and Point Cadet.\nThe applicant must submit an application, an application fee, and a survey, which shows everything that is to be placed on the waters and waterbottoms to be leased and on the adjacent uplands. Every lease requires the lessee to abide by all applicable state, federal, and local regulations or statutes; any zoning ordinances; and any governmental regulations that may apply to the activity. The lease process is usually triggered by the receipt of the public notice of the proposed project from the Department of Marine Resources. The office responds by advising that a lease will be required for the use. The Department is notified when a lease application is received and proceeds with its permitting process. In addition, the office coordinates with the Department to ensure that a lease is not authorized for an activity that is not permitted by the regulatory authorities. The lease is not issued until after all applicable permits have been obtained by the applicant.\nNext, a site-specific appraisal for each of these leases is obtained. The appraiser uses a three-part approach. First, he arrives at a value based upon direct comparison of the property, return on value of the property, and percentage gross casino revenues of the property. The appraiser then reconciles these three figures to arrive at fair market rental value. Finally, this figure (which was determined by independent appraisal) is nonnegotiable. The figure is presented to the lessee, and in each instance, the figure has been accepted and the lease executed.\nOther terms of the lease are negotiable to a certain extent. If there are provisions that the lessee would like to include, they are included if possible. Some provisions are statutorily mandated. Although the law allows a term of up to 40 years, terms of the leases have been limited to 10 years, with one instance of 15 years. A statutorily mandated rent review and an adjustment every 5 years is included as a provision of each lease. Public access to the leased areas is required if the lessee is able to provide it. In addition, the lessor recognizes that the lessee can take reasonable measures to protect the security of his property. The lease may be terminated upon the suspension or cancellation of the casino license. The state secures an indemnity and hold harmless provision in each of the leases. Moreover, liability insurance is required of the lessee.\nAlthough the lease program was in place prior to the passage of casino gambling on the Coast, the revenues, as one might expect, have increased dramatically with the 10 casino leases. The revenues from the tidelands are spent as directed by statute. The revenues are used first for the administration of the Public Trust Tidelands Act and, secondly, to replace any lost tax revenues. To date, none have been lost. Finally, the balance of the lease revenues is disbursed to the Department of Marine Resources. Mississippi law provides that the DMR use these monies for new and extra programs of tidelands management including preservation, conservation, public access, and public education. Recently the Legislature has made the fund expenditures part of the DMR appropriation process.\nRecommendations for Changes in Permitting Casinos in Mississippi Coastal Wetlands\nRichard McLaughlin\nAssociate Professor of Law and Director\nMississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Legal Program\nUniversity of Mississippi Law Center\nIn 1994 NOAA's office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management issued a report that was part of its ongoing evaluation of state coastal management programs. That 1994 report was somewhat critical of the way the State of Mississippi permitted casino development within the coastal zone. In particular, the NOAA evaluation expressed concern regarding how the state was allowing casinos in certain areas that were designated in the formal coastal program for other uses, such as commercial fishing ports, recreational marinas, and water-dependent industries. In addition, the report expressed some concern regarding the procedures that were used to allow adjustments in the Coastal Use Plan. The procedures were deemed inadequate, and the report suggested that the state re-evaluate its current regulatory program to see if any changes were warranted.\nUpon that recommendation, the Department of Marine Resources contacted the Mississippi-Alabama Sea Grant Legal Program at the University of Mississippi Law Center. The Department of Marine Resources asked whether or not the legal program would be interested in taking on the project of evaluating the current regulatory structure and providing some recommendations. The Sea Grant Legal Program accepted the challenge and, in April 1996, submitted its findings.\nThe recommendations of the legal program can be divided into two basic categories. The first category is composed of entirely discretionary recommendations. The reason that they are discretionary is that the state in these areas is in general compliance with existing federal and state law. Therefore, the recommendations may clarify or improve certain aspects of the management of the coastal zone, but changes are not absolutely required. Examples in this first category include a recommendation that the Commission on Marine Resources more diligently ensure that all applicants provide detailed descriptions of all associated and secondary developments that are likely to occur. The Commission should then make sure that these impacts are fully considered in all of the permitting decisions that are ultimately made.\nAnother recommendation in the discretionary category encourages the state to re-examine the jurisdictional definitions within the coastal program. For example, some confusion exits regarding whether or not a recreational marina that is dredged from an upland area does or does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Coastal Program. The language is cloudy and needs to be clarified and tightened. Yet another discretionary recommendation encourages the Commission to better define water-dependent activities and water-dependent industry. This issue is discretionary because broad leeway has generally been granted to states like Mississippi to make the determination of what is defined as a water-dependent activity or industry. There is probably no legal problem with the way the state currently defines water-dependency.\nMost people acknowledge that casinos have to be viewed as water-dependent activities because the Mississippi legislation has required gaming to exist only on floating structures. However, water-dependent status does not mean that casinos should be placed without limits all along the Coast. For example, casinos should not be located on sites suitable for water-dependent industry. Sites suitable for water-dependent industry are those sites that are located adjacent to navigable channels, which are suitable for commercial water-borne commerce. Casinos do not need a position adjacent to a navigable channel that would support water-borne commerce. In fact, those locations are very limited in number. They are unique. Allowing casinos on those sites prevents other industries that are truly water-dependent from locating there. Consequently, the Commission on Marine Resources should re-evaluate the definitions of activities that can be allowed on sites suitable for water-dependent industry and close any loopholes that may allow casinos to be placed on industrial sites. Similarly, the Commission should tighten the definition on water-dependent activities to ensure that nongaming activities such as theaters, child care facilities, and hotels are not placed on floating structures over the state's submerged water bottoms. Generally, those services are already prohibited from being located on floating structures. However, there have been a growing number of requests to situate those kinds of activities on vessels. The policy therefore needs to be tightened and clarified.\nThe second general category of recommendations comprises those that are not discretionary. They are not discretionary because they will bring the state into compliance with existing state or federal law. An example of a nondiscretionary recommendation would be for the state to redefine the \"commercial\" designation within its Use Plan in the Coastal Program. The Use Plan is similar to a zoning map. The entire coastal zone is mapped and certain zones are delineated where particular activities can take place and other activities cannot occur. Most casinos are located in these commercially designated zones. The Coastal Program allows in those commercial zones, according to express language, seafood processing, commercial fishing ports, recreational marinas, and associated development.\nNowhere in the Coastal Program are casinos or casino-related development mentioned. Clearly, there is a difference in the impact between a commercial fishing port or a seafood processing plant and a casino and all the related casino development that is adjacent. Casinos were placed in the commercially designated zones because they were the most suitable locations at the time. Many of the casinos have been placed on what were once seafood processing plants or commercial fishing facilities. These sites may, in fact, be uniquely suitable for casinos. However, the state cannot ignore the express language within the Coastal Program. If the state wants to have casinos within this commercial designation, it should amend the Coastal Program to allow casino development within that designation. If the state does not choose to do that, there is a possibility that a legal challenge may arise at some point in the future, with someone challenging a permit saying that the state is allowing an activity that is expressly prohibited within the Coastal Program.\nAnother nondiscretionary recommendation is that the Commission on Marine Resources provide full written findings of fact and law whenever it renders a permit decision. This requirement of full written findings is clearly required under the State Coastal Wetlands Protection Act, as well as in Administrative Procedures within the state. The requirement, in fact, was the reason a recent decision by the Commission on Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks was overturned by Chancery Court in Harrison County. The Commission failed to make formal written findings when it made a permit decision.\nThe last few nondiscretionary recommendations will probably be viewed by some observers as controversial. The first is a recommendation that the Commission on Marine Resources clarify its requirements for adjustments in the Coastal Use Plan. On several occasions, casinos have requested adjustments in the Use Plan to allow a casino to locate within a zone that had been previously designated as a zone that prohibited casino-like activity. There is no express requirement within the Coastal Program that a test be used requiring an applicant either to show a mistake in the original zoning plan or a change in circumstances of the neighborhood or the neighboring area before they grant an adjustment. However, this so-called \"mistake or change in circumstance rule\" is one of the most well-entrenched common law rules in the State of Mississippi. The rule has been applied on dozens of occasions by the State Supreme Court in the zoning context, and although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on this issue in the context of adjustments to the Coastal Program, a Chancery Court in Harrison County has done so. Recently in regard to a casino site on the Biloxi Back Bay, the court approved the \"mistake or change in circumstance\" test."}
